Season 19 finalist <a href=#><strong>Erich Schwer</strong></a> is no stranger to controversy — and he once again found himself in hot water when <a href=#>texts between him and ex-girlfriend <strong>Amanda Kaylor</strong> </a>were leaked last week.</p><p>In the purported text exchange, which was published online Thursday, September 15, the reality star — who is <a href=#><strong>Gabby Windey</strong></a>’s final suitor — chose to appear on the show while he was still in a relationship with Amanda.</p><p>“I know this isn’t ideal, I wanted to do this to see if there was something else I could do with my life. I really like you Amanda,” he allegedly told the mother of one in a series of text messages that were leaked on Thursday, September 15. “I didn’t think it would be a big deal but I understand how you feel, I’m sorry and I understand if you don’t want to see me anymore.”</p><p>Amanda was stunned at Erich’s audacity. “You just expected me to continue dating you while you go on a reality show to ‘find love,’” she reportedly questioned her then-boyfriend, whom she dated from January to March.</p><p>“I am sorry I really didn’t think this all through. … I didn’t realize the implications,” Erich allegedly responded. I am sorry I thought we could get on the same page about this. I really didn’t mean for this to hurt you.”</p><p>The aspect she was most shocked by, however, was Erich’s “lack of honesty,” Amanda exclusively told Us Weekly ahead of the Tuesday, September 20, Bachelorette finale.</p><p>“I feel like it was something that he maybe had in his mind longer than … obviously I found out right before [he began filming] and just the fact that he was continuously seeing me, staying at my house,” she explained. “He let me introduce him to [my son] the week leading up to that. … In my head that’s kind of messed up to do knowing that that’s a potential option.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Amanda-Kaylor-Bachelorette.jpg><p>Amanda added that she also doesn’t believe Erich’s claims about when he found out that he was selected for the show on March 10. “I was just blind-sided and hurt,” she told Us.</p><p>The pair’s relationship was “very intense,” Amanda revealed, despite the fact that it was “short-lived” and the two never put a label on it. “We were obsessed with each other,” she shared, claiming that “every single day that month he was texting me, ‘I need to be with you, I need to see you.’”</p><p>Despite the heartache, Amanda, who told Us she will not be watching Tuesday night’s finale, ultimately wishes Erich nothing but happiness — as long as he’s genuine in his romance with Gabby.</p><p>“If him and Gabby are for real, and he moved on and found someone, then I’m happy for him. I just hope that this isn’t just part of his plan to gain something from this because I mean, he really had me fooled,” she told Us, adding that if she were the Bachelorette co-lead, she “would be questioning [the relationship],” and asserted that Erich went on the reality show with “bad intentions.”</p><p>While she doesn’t know what — if anything — her ex told Gabby about their relationship, as long as “she knows the full truth and still wants to be with him and they’re happy then I wish them all the best.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bachelorette season 19 finale airs on Tuesday, September 20 on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270Z6rrZ1dqMGivoyeqaKbmKh6psSMq5yvnZGhwG7Ax6isoKCkqHqwuoygmJuaqWK%2FsLnAp5qeZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbachelorette-star-erich-s-ex-reveals-thoughts-on-gabby-romance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbachelorette-star-erich-s-ex-reveals-thoughts-on-gabby-romance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbachelorette-star-erich-s-ex-reveals-thoughts-on-gabby-romance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbachelorette-star-erich-s-ex-reveals-thoughts-on-gabby-romance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbachelorette-star-erich-s-ex-reveals-thoughts-on-gabby-romance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbachelorette-star-erich-s-ex-reveals-thoughts-on-gabby-romance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-tall-is-jay-glazer-everything-about-the-nfl-thursday-night-commentator-from-fox.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-tall-is-jay-glazer-everything-about-the-nfl-thursday-night-commentator-from-fox.html>How Tall Is Jay Glazer?
