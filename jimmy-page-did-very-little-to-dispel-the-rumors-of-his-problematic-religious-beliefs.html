This all started because Page's obsession with Aleister Crowley, leading to the belief that Page was a Satanist. The Led Zeppelin star did have the chance to shut down the rumors completely in the past, but he gave an interesting answer that still left that mysterious door open.</p><p>Page said, "I don't really want to go on about my personal beliefs or my involvement in magic," he told Rolling Stone. "I'm not interested in turning anybody on to anybody that I'm turned on to. If people want to find things, they find them themselves."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jimmy-page-78th-venice-film-festival-photo-call.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-04t130751-515.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Led Zeppelin Let A Detail Slip About Their Encounter With Elvis Presley During Their Interview With David Letterman</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Led Zeppelin kept things brief discussing Elvis alongside David Letterman, but they let quite the detail slip about his entourage.</span><p>Page did not put the rumors to bed and adding to it, Led Zeppelin had links to the devil with Stairway to Heaven.

However, fans online have speculated, wondering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">if Jimmy Page is a pagan</a>. One user in particular seems to think that Page's beliefs are more agnostic than anything else.</p><p>Andrew Brown wrote on Quora, "If one were to label Page, he or she might call him a “mystic” rather than a pagan but “private researcher” might be an even better description. “Pagan” makes me think of someone who “worships” a god or group of gods and Page seems more agnostic. In modern times, the term has been much associated with Wicca. I read in a magazine decades ago that Jimmy Page was interested in comparative religions - more of a researcher than a ritual practitioner."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jimmy-page-becoming-led-zeppelin-red-carpet-1.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jimmy-page-was-upset-after-robert-plant-tore-up-a-led-zeppelin-contract-worth-800-million-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jimmy Page Was Upset After Robert Plant Tore Up A Led Zeppelin Contract Worth A Rumored $800 Million</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Robert Plant took two days to think about a massive offer, and his final decision was one that left Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin very upset.</span><p>The fans add that Jimmy Page grew tired of answering questions about his religion.</p><p>"I can’t see him getting into rituals and such. For one thing, he grew tired of being associated with the occult and often refuses to discuss the topic with American journalists. For another, I once read an interview where Page thinks he might have seen a ghost at Headley Grange and says he withdrew from the apparition because he didn’t want to encounter “something like that."</p><p>"If that’s the case, I can’t see how he would be engaging in rituals, trying to invoke supernatural entities for magical purposes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Page kept quiet about the matter, it wasn't the only time Led Zeppelin were associated with the devil.</p><h2 id=robert-plant-and-jimmy-page-denied-satanic-messages-in-stairway-to-heaven>Robert Plant And Jimmy Page Denied Satanic Messages In Stairway To Heaven</h2><p>Adding to the controversy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Led Zeppelin had to deal with the rumor of satanic messages in Stairway to Heaven</a>. The facts were out there after Paul Crouch played the record backwards.</p><p>The lyrics said, “Here’s to my sweet Satan/The one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is Satan/He will give those with him 666/There was a little toolshed where he made us suffer, sad Satan."</p><p>Robert Plant refused to add to the rumors. He said, "To me it’s very sad, because ‘Stairway to Heaven’ was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that’s not my idea of making music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time, Jimmy Page was also quick to turn down the suggestion. He said, “I’m going to go straight back to The Beatles here because there was a time when somebody wrote a thesis about Paul McCartney being dead”.</p><p>He continues, “If you playback the records, I’m being serious here even though it’s crazy, but, if you playback the records there was something that says ‘Paul Is Dead’ and then they started to playback a whole manner of records. Of course, we were going to be main candidates for it, and somebody said, ‘It says my sweet satan in it’, and I thought, ‘Gosh, it’s hard enough writing music one way round'”.</p><p>Not what Led Zeppelin expected to deal with following such a legendary release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqWdrnqxrcaeZJ2hlGLDpr7YZqOirKShsm7AzmaboqugmrluwMeeZKutnaS%2FtHnOn2ShoaNivbO7waWcppmknrBuvsSloKChn6rAbq7EpaCenqNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-page-did-very-little-to-dispel-the-rumors-of-his-problematic-religious-beliefs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjimmy-page-did-very-little-to-dispel-the-rumors-of-his-problematic-religious-beliefs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-page-did-very-little-to-dispel-the-rumors-of-his-problematic-religious-beliefs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjimmy-page-did-very-little-to-dispel-the-rumors-of-his-problematic-religious-beliefs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-page-did-very-little-to-dispel-the-rumors-of-his-problematic-religious-beliefs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-page-did-very-little-to-dispel-the-rumors-of-his-problematic-religious-beliefs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./josh-meyers-says-demi-moore-ruined-that-70s-show-finale-scene.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./josh-meyers-says-demi-moore-ruined-that-70s-show-finale-scene.html>Josh Meyers Says Demi Moore Ruined 'That '70s Show' Finale Scene</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jenny-mollen-talks-botox-cosmetic-day-anti-aging-tips.html>Jenny Mollen Talks 'Botox Cosmetic Day, Anti-Aging Tips</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jenny-mollen-talks-botox-cosmetic-day-anti-aging-tips.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
