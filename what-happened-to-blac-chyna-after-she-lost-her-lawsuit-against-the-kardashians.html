<time>20 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There were some highs and lows in Season 2 of Hulu's The Kardashians. Kourtney prepped for her wedding, Kim whittled her waist down for the Met Gala, and the family faced a $100 million lawsuit from Rob Kardashian's former partner, Blac Chyna. According to Chyna, the stripper-turned-influencer's career was "permanently damaged" by the cancelation of her reality show Rob & Chyna, which she alleged was orchestrated by the Kardashians and their influence over the network.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The verdict didn't end favorably for Chyna. The trial aired some not-so-savory, alleged details of the couple's relationship and family members had to testify. But despite the loss of the extra $100 million in the bank, Chyna's presence across social media and OnlyFans makes it seem like the model is not doing too poorly since the trial's conclusion. Let's see what she's been up to.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-has-history-with-the-kardashians>Blac Chyna Has History With The Kardashians</h2><p>Once upon a time, Chyna and the Kardashians were in each other’s social circles.</p><p>In the original Keeping Up With the Kardashians series, Chyna even came on the show as a friend of Kim’s. At the time, Chyna was dating rapper Tyga, who was friends with rapper-mogul Kanye West. According to reports, Kim and Chyna met and became friends <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">through their then-partners</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kourtney-blac-chyna-kim.jpeg><p>When Chyna and Tyga split, the rapper moved on with the family’s youngest, Kylie, and soon, the friendship between the family and Chyna soured.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="There’s Reason To Believe Tyga & Selena Gomez Are Dating ">There’s Reason To Believe Tyga & Selena Gomez Are Dating</a></span></p><p>A few years later, Chyna re-entered the Kardashian circle. This time for dating Rob. Within several months, the pair were engaged and expecting a daughter, whom they named Dream.</p><p>Their reality show, Rob & Chyna, aired in 2017, chronicling the ups and downs of their tumultuous relationship. The pair split after a year and a half together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While a second season was in the works, it never made it to air, which eventually led to Chyna's lawsuit.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-39-s-lawsuit-led-to-a-heated-trial>Blac Chyna's Lawsuit Led To A Heated Trial</h2><p>According to Chyna's lawsuit, the cancellation of Rob & Chyna stemmed from the influence of the Kardashians. She named the family’s matriarch, Kris Jenner, along with Kim, Khloe, and Kylie for blocking the renewal with the network, which she alleged led to a loss of millions in future income.</p><p>Kim and Khloe denied these claims in court, and the family countersued that Chyna had been physically abusive towards Rob during their time together.</p><p>Kylie took to the stand, testifying that she had been concerned about her brother during his relationship. She shared that her ex-Tyga, who had also previously dated Chyna, told her that his ex had allegedly slashed the rapper with a knife, <a href=# rel=nofollow>resulting in a 6-inch scar</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="The Truth Behind Blac Chyna And Tyga's Relationship And Breakup">The Truth Behind Blac Chyna And Tyga's Relationship And Breakup</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, Kylie claimed she had received death threats from Chyna in the past but did not report it to the police.</p><p>In another testimony, Rob took to the stand and spoke about a particular incident that he stated resulted in the demise of their relationship.</p><p>During two nights in December 2017, Rob alleged Chyna had attacked him with a metal rod landing several blows to his face and body, and wrapped a phone charging cord around his neck. That same night, according to Rob, Chyna had even pointed a gun at him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="Everything There Is To Know About Blac Chyna And Rob Kardashian's Relationship">Everything There Is To Know About Blac Chyna And Rob Kardashian's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Chyna has denied these claims, saying that she had only picked up the unloaded gun from the nightstand in a joking manner but never pointed it at him and that the claims were false and defamatory.</p><p>"You don't point guns at your fiancé's head," <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rob claimed</a>.

The <a href=# rel=nofollow>jury found that none</a> of the members defamed Chyna, and they did not interfere with the cancellation of her reality show.</p><p>While the $100 million lawsuit against the Kardashians didn’t go as planned, Chyna has been keeping busy.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a>, her OnlyFans account brought her a whopping 20 million dollars a month in income in 2021 – who knows how much she rakes in now.</p><p>On her OnlyFans account, she shared that she started it to supplement her other ventures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m on OnlyFans so I can support the music because that stuff is not cheap at all,” Chyna said. “Getting studio time, engineers, wardrobe, marketing, I’m using all these different hustles to support that and my kids.”</p><p>She has also alleged she does not receive child support.</p><p>On social media, Chyna continues to promote her cosmetics business, Lashed, and makes time for her two children, King Cairo and Dream, who, according to her Instagram, might become budding <a href=# rel=nofollow>mini-fashion influencers</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="Who Is Blac Chyna's Mom, Tokyo Toni?">Who Is Blac Chyna's Mom, Tokyo Toni?</a></span></p><p>Chyna's lawyer, Lynne Ciani, declared that based on factors from the trial, <a href=#>there would be an appeal</a>.</p><p>She said, “Two things. Number one, the jury found that Chyna had not physically abused Rob Kardashian. Number two, the jury found that all four defendants intentionally interfered with [Chyna’s] contracts with the E!
