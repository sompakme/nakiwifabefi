Dua started out singing on her YouTube channel just to get her voice heard. She would sing covers of some of her favorite artists such as, The Weekend, Alessia Cara, Justin Bieber and even&nbsp;Etta James.</p><p>Of course she was a YouTube success, and she gained quite a following during her time recording videos. Many teenagers go to YouTube with hopes to become famous, or go viral for a new trend. This just shows that Dua is just like any other teen.</p><h2 id=chris-martin-was-in-the-studio-with-her>Chris Martin Was In The Studio With Her</h2><p>One of the moments Dua started to realize how big she was becoming was a day when she was recording a track and the Coldplay member came in to give her a listen. Anyone would be surprised, freaked out and amazed to see a celebrity in the studio just to hear them sing. Dua kept her cool and went to work on her next song.</p><p><strong>Collaborating with a member from Coldplay&nbsp;was a huge deal for an upcoming teenage pop sensation.&nbsp;The song titled,&nbsp;Homesick,&nbsp;is the record that Chris Martin appeared on.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dua and Chris both wrote the song which went on to be a successful track.

Sean Paul is a successful Jamaican rapper. These collaborations opened up a whole new world for Dua. Previously she had been singing in the Pop genre. Broadening her horizons would prove to add to her fame and success.

It took hard work, dedication and loads of confidence to get where she is today. Even though she always loved to sing she had to stay persistent to get the attention of others. At 15 years old she decided to tell her parents that she needed to return to London. They had moved from the city to reside in Kosovo, which did not have the theatre schooling she desired.</p><p><strong>Even though she was away from her parents and on her own she stayed focused on her music. There aren't many fifteen year olds who leave home and end up making it big time.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was literally on a mission to make her dreams come true. Plus, living away from home had its perks. She was able to mature quicker than most. This experience totally plays in to her success and dedication today. Living alone taught her to persevere through any circumstance. It would be another 3 years until she officially signed a record deal.</p><h2 id=she-always-wanted-to-be-a-singer>She Always Wanted To Be A Singer</h2><p>She did not automatically believe her dream would come true but ultimately it did. All through her&nbsp;childhood she adored singing and listening to music. How many kids know what they want to do from such a young age and actually go through with it?</p><p><strong>At only 9 years old she found herself singing and practicing her music with 14 and 15 year olds.</strong></p><p>Modeling was something she did on the side of pursuing her singing career. Dua made sure she always kept her eyes on what she wanted to do, and never lost confidence that she was capable of doing it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-fashion-sense-is-banging>Her Fashion Sense Is Banging</h2><p>Okay, so not only is she a pop star, but have you noticed how&nbsp;well she dresses? Her style says and embodies what it is to be a powerful and fearless woman. Dua completely owns the whole blue eye shadow thing. She loves to pamper her eyes with eye liners, mascara and a blue sparkly eye shadows to top it all off. Dua gives off this super star vibe.</p><p><strong>In some of her music videos she can be seen in combat boots and attire that displays a "tough girl" look.</strong></p><p>When out walking in the street, you might catch her in Adidas sweats, like any normal young adult. She isn't too flashy with her style, which lets us know she is really down to earth.</p><p>Even though she is not a super flashy person, you will still see her rocking Chanel and Marc Jacobs accessories. When it comes down to it, the accessories are the most important part anyway right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-on-the-cover-of-teen-vogue>She Is On The Cover Of Teen Vogue</h2><p>The Teen Vogue&nbsp;magazine is a&nbsp;well known magazine, that has had stars like Kylie Jenner, Nicki Minaj, Emma Roberts, Shay Mitchell and many more on their covers.&nbsp;Teen Vogue helps to get celebrities more attention and attraction. The magazine has a huge audience so being on the cover, or even featured in the magazine is a pretty big deal.</p><p><strong>Dua Lipa appeared on the cover for the November 2016 issue. If you recall, 2016 was the year that she was just getting started big time in her industry. This publicity certainly helped her to obtain more status and really get her name out there.</strong></p><p>On the cover she is seen wearing a golden shimmery top, with a white skirt and orange eye shadow to go along with it. She was dressed really nice for this cover since she was not revealing too much skin at all. Dua really knows when to show skin and when not to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-her-early-years-she-jammed-to-1-2-step>In Her Early Years She Jammed To&nbsp;1, 2 Step</h2><p>Who remembers the early 2000's hit with Ciara and Missy Elliot? The single was a hip-hop song that was great to dance to. It gave off this "cool kid" vibe and attracted millions of listeners all over the world. The song was released in 2004 with an awesome video to go with it.</p><p>Apparently Dua was one of those listeners. She recalls dancing to the song in her room and singing along to the tunes. This really makes her seem more human and less celebrity. Everyone wants to relate to celebrities and understand their lives. Dua was not that much different than other kids her age. Dua also recalls growing up listening to&nbsp;Destiny's&nbsp;Child,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Britney Spears.&nbsp;Her taste in music during her younger days helped inspire her to be the woman she is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-of-her-songs-was-streamed-1-billion-times>One Of Her Songs Was Streamed 1 Billion Times</h2><p>There aren't many stars who get their music streamed 1 billion times.&nbsp;New Rules&nbsp;was the popular song that everyone, all over the world, wanted to listen to. The lyrics show the story of a girl who is in love with a guy who doesn't love her back. She's encouraging herself to let the phone ring when he calls, and to basically never let him have a part in her life again. This is one of those songs people sing after a bad break with a bad guy. The lyrics encourage listeners to be empowered by loving themselves and not accepting less than they deserve.</p><p>In the music video Dua starts out in her bedroom with a group of girls. As she sings the lyrics, she's reminding all of the girls of the new rules that are set in place. They dance, and&nbsp;prace around until it's time to go out to the pool area. Now that they're out of the room they're ready, to be independent, strong and empowered. With all of the women's movements going on, it's no wonder this video obtained so many views.</p><h2 id=she-really-knows-her-stuff-when-it-comes-to-music>She Really Knows Her Stuff When It Comes To Music</h2><p>Dua is one of those singers who knows what they're doing. She knows the kind of music she wants to sing, how she wants to be portrayed, and how to attract an audience. She's completely in tuned with the music industry and her fan base.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Dua knows that as a 22-year-old woman, she needs to sing certain songs and have a certain rhythm to make it big.

When listening to her songs she uses unique beats and rhythms that go perfectly with her voice. Some of her songs almost sound sort of Techno, but still Pop. On top of knowing how to make hits her voice is amazing to say the least. Her deep sound is so unique for Pop artists of today.</p><h2 id=when-she-was-15-she-was-focused-on-music>When She Was 15 She Was Focused On Music</h2><p>At 15, most kids want to hang out with friends, or go to parties and date. Not Dua. Dua was completely focused on bringing her dreams to life. At only 15-years-old, she was already trying to make her name known to the world. Dua knew the way to accomplish her dreams would be hard work and dedication. She really did not let anything or anyone distract her. This is amazing to see from someone so young because she has this burning passion for what she does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It interests everyone to see someone so focused, especially at a young age. Dua also kept herself innocent and wholesome. She didn't do crazy stunts or acts of attention, to bring fame to her in an unwanted way. Her persistence in music was something that formed over a long period of time. Dua was not an over night sensation, but that didn't mean she wasn't willing to accomplish her goals by any means necessary.</p><h2 id=18-years-old-and-a-record-deal>18 Years Old And A Record Deal</h2><p>After 3 years of writing, and singing covers on YouTube, Dua was finally going to get the break that she wanted her whole life. The year was 2015, when she signed her first record deal with Warner Brothers Records. They're a huge record company with a crazy global reach.</p><p><strong>At just 18-years-old she was about to enter the deal of a lifetime, with a reliable popular label.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time Dua was not aware of how big her deal was. In the coming months and years she would realize how big her name was becoming. She paved her way into Pop stardom, with the helps of very successful others along the way. A few of her first songs on the label, were&nbsp;New Love&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Thinking 'Bout You.&nbsp;</i>Both songs have a video on YouTube and were released in 2017. They fit in with her other songs since the lyrics are about being in love and how this makes her feel.</p><h2 id=she-looks-amazingly-beautiful>She Looks Amazingly Beautiful</h2><p>Dua is a 5 foot 8 inches tall brunette with amazing features.

Dua won't sing a song that isn't at least co-written by her.</p><p><strong>She wants to be in control of what she says and the message she sends to the audience.
