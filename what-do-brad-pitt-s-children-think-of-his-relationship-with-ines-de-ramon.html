Their fame grew when they became a couple, with fans affectionately branding them Brangelina. So when Hollywood's golden couple divorced, it shocked the public.</p><p>Upon their split, Jolie gained sole custody of their six children, Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivian, and despite his efforts, Pitt was only granted visitation rights. Besides a messy custody battle, Angelina Jolie's and Brad Pitt's divorce was tumultuous and played out in public. It's easy to imagine how the separation emotionally affected the superstars' children.</p><p>What made things worse was that, according to Jolie, their kids witnessed a major argument between their parents shortly before the divorce. Their parents' dating other people must have also caused significant changes in their lives, leading fans to wonder how the kids felt about Pitt's girlfriend, Ines de Ramon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-brad-pitt-39-s-relationship-with-his-children-since-his-divorce-from-angelina-jolie>Inside Brad Pitt's Relationship With His Children Since His Divorce From Angelina Jolie</h2><p>Brad Pitt has been open about his history with alcoholism, which occurred throughout much of his relationship with his ex-wife, Angelina Jolie. Although Pitt later sought treatment for his addiction, according to Jolie and her eldest adopted son Maddox, the scars stemming from his behavior while under the influence left a profound impact on the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt.jpg><p>Although Maddox was given Pitt's surname when the latter married Angelina Jolie, the two have always had a rocky relationship. Jolie would later allege that Brad Pitt had physically assaulted Maddox during a plane ride, which motivated her to file for divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Authorities investigated Brad Pitt's alleged altercation with Maddox, but he was ultimately cleared of all charges. Although sources close to the Babylon actor leaked that Pitt and Maddox had tried many times to reconcile their relationship, they've never found common ground.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-spent-an-absolute-fortunte-on-nannies-for-their-six-kids.jpg><p>Being famous stars, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have always tried to protect their privacy as well as that of their children, so it's been difficult for the media to gather how close Pitt has been with his other two adopted children Zahara and Pax since his split from Jolie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pitt has often spoken affectionately of his adopted children in various interviews. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The List</a>, Pitt once told Vanity Fair that he was proud of Zahara for being accepted into Spelman College and praised her for her intelligence and artistic interests.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related <a href=#>Angelina Jolieâ€™s Tattoo Artist Apologizes After She Reveals New Ink That Fans Think Is A Diss To Brad Pitt</a></span></p><p>While Jolie was granted sole custody of all six of their children, Brad Pitt was allowed visitation rights with their three youngest biological children, Shilo and twins Knox and Vivian. As such, Pitt has gotten to see his children regularly. By all accounts, he has a close and loving relationship with them, particularly Shilo, who has gone public about forgiving her father for his past alcohol abuse.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to E! News</a>, a source associated with the Pitt family stated that Brad Pitt supports Shilo, Vivian, and Knox in their endeavors and has encouraged them to do what makes them happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The anonymous source added that Brad Pitt has often spent time with his three children at home and has tried to keep their lives as normal as possible.</p><h2 id=who-is-brad-pitt-39-s-girlfriend-ines-de-ramon>Who Is Brad Pitt's Girlfriend Ines de Ramon?</h2><p>Brad Pitt has been linked to several Hollywood starlets since his divorce from Angelina Jolie, including models Emily Ratajowski and Nicole Poturalski. However, his most serious relationship since the dissolution of his second marriage has been with Ines de Ramon.</p><p>Pitt's new love interest had the media and fans wondering <a href=#>who Ines de Ramon was </a>before she met the actor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Was Ines De Ramon Doing Between Her Split From Paul Wesley And Dating Brad Pitt?</a></span></p><p>As it turned out, Ines de Ramon was born in Paris, France to a Moroccan Muslim father and a French Catholic mother. She has worked as a health coach, social media influencer, and jewelry designer with businesses in Los Angeles, California. Her customers have included some of Hollywood's biggest stars, such as socialite Kourtney Kardashian and model Hailey Berber.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/what-do-brad-pitt-s-children-think-of-his-relationship-with-ines-de-ramon_.jpg><p>It's alleged that Brad Pitt was introduced to Ines de Ramon through mutual friends in the industry.

While friends of Brad Pitt first stated that the actor initially liked the actress but wasn't in love with her, things would later take a drastic turn the more time they spent together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/is-brad-pitt-close-to-his-youngest-kids-twins-vivienne-and-knox_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pitt's inner circle later revealed that he had gotten past the initial stages with de Ramon and was now very serious about her after seeing how well she fit into his life and got along with his friends. However, there remained setbacks in their relationship: Ines de Remain was still legally married to her estranged husband, actor Paul Wesley. It's alleged that Pitt provided moral support to Ines through her separation from her ex, and the two eventually divorced.</p><p>The other issue was how Ines de Ramon, who had no children of her own, got along with Brad Pitt's six kids, specifically his three youngest children.</p><p>Initially, Brad Pitt opted out of introducing Ines de Ramon to his children. According to a report in Us Weekly, Pitt refrained from having his kids meet de Ramon until they had established a more solid connection. The magazine added that Brad Pitt took his relationship seriously with the jewelry designer and was determined to avoid making the same mistakes he did in his previous relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brad-pitt.jpg><p>After a considerable time dating, The Daily Mail wrote that sources close to the actor revealed that he had finally introduced Ines de Ramon to most of his kids.
