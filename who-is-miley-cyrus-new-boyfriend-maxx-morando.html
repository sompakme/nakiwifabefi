Now, she's reportedly dating musician Maxx Morando. It's been a while since Cyrus was linked to someone <a href=#>following her divorce from Liam Hemsworth</a> and <a href=#>her "rebound" relationship with Cody Simpson</a>. So with <a href=#>the Wrecking Ball singer</a> keeping it "lowkey" with her new beau, fans are starting to wonder what's really going on. Well, we've got some answers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Hannah Montana' Ruined Billy Ray Cyrus's Career, According To Him</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-maxx-morando>Who Is Maxx Morando?</h2><p>Morando is currently in a band called Liily. He was also the drummer for the Regrettes from 2015 to 2018. But recently, the California native started venturing into fashion. In September 2021, he worked with designer Shane Kastl to create an outfit for Cyrus. "This look is a one-of-a-kind collaboration between two of my favorite emerging artists, Maxx Morando and Shane Kastl," said <a href=#>the Hannah Montana star</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Their collaboration is the perfect example of sustainability becoming the next fashion phase," Cyrus continued. "And it proves that anything can be reinvented, which resonates with me deeply." The 23-year-old drummer also keeps a low profile. He barely posts on Instagram, making fans clueless about his interests, aside from music. But in case you were wondering, Morando is reportedly worth $1.5 million. That's still a huge chunk. Just don't compare it to <a href=#>Cyrus' hefty $160 million net worth</a>.</p><p>She's been in the business since she was a child, after all. She made $15,000 per episode on Hannah Montana, launched her solo music career at 15, bagged $13 million per season on The Voice, raked in $62 million from her Bangerz Tour, and starred in some blockbusters. Don't even get us started on her social media earnings where she charges $2 million per ad post.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Miley Cyrus Has Such A Difficult Relationship With Her Mother</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-miley-cyrus-amp-maxx-morando-start-dating>When Did Miley Cyrus & Maxx Morando Start Dating?</h2><p>Fans believe that Cyrus could have been referring to Morando when she debuted her new single You during her New Year's Eve party. The lyrics read: "I got some baggage / Let's do some damage / I am not made for no horsey and carriage / You know I'm savage / You're looking past it / I want that late night sweet magic / That forever lasting love / But only if it's with you." The two were first spotted together at the Gucci Love Parade in November 2021. On New Year's Eve, they were seen kissing and holding hands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She's happily dating Maxx. It's official between them," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told E! News</a> who added that the two bond over their love for music. "They are both artistic and creative, so they bond over being musicians." Another insider confirmed the New Year's Eve sighting, saying that Morando was also interacting with Davidson. "He was backstage with Miley and Pete at the New Year's Eve rehearsals and taping having a good time with them," said the second source. "They were are all super friendly with one another and seemed to have a great night."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Miley Cyrus Have The Highest Net Worth Of All Disney Channel Stars?</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-miley-cyrus-and-maxx-morando-39-s-relationship>Inside Miley Cyrus And Maxx Morando's Relationship</h2><p>The new couple has been keeping their relationship under wraps. Neither has confirmed nor denied the romance despite their public appearances and paparazzi photos of them together. It's probably due to Cyrus' previous issues with highly publicized breakups. "A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that," she said of her divorce from Hemsworth in comparison with her split with Simpson at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So today, it came out that me and my boyfriend have broken up," she continued. "It was confirmed by a 'reliable source' even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the two individuals that are participating in it." The Party in the U.S.A. hitmaker hates how the media meddles with her personal affairs which she's still trying to figure out herself. "Like everybody else at this age, we're just deciding who we wanna be with our lives, what we wanna do with our lives," she said of her split from Simpson. "So, don't make it some drama story if next week we're out hanging out or getting pizza. We've been friends for 10 years and we're gonna continue to be friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Cyrus seems to have a few spies in her circle. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A source told Us Weekly</a> in March 2022 that the two have been "exploring things" these days. "It's a new relationship. They're still getting to know each other at the moment," they said. "They're having fun and have been spending a lot of time together. They're exploring things and seeing where it goes." The insider added that the lovebirds are "very compatible with each other."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The True Story Behind Why Miley Cyrus Changed Her Name</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucilnLJlk66%2Ftr%2BMp5ywZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWdlsW5ecyoqZqmlKR8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-miley-cyrus-new-boyfriend-maxx-morando.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-miley-cyrus-new-boyfriend-maxx-morando.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-miley-cyrus-new-boyfriend-maxx-morando.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-miley-cyrus-new-boyfriend-maxx-morando.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-miley-cyrus-new-boyfriend-maxx-morando.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-miley-cyrus-new-boyfriend-maxx-morando.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-officer-michael-fanone-revered-hero-police-has-a-spider-web-tattoo-on-his-neck-what-does-it.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-officer-michael-fanone-revered-hero-police-has-a-spider-web-tattoo-on-his-neck-what-does-it.html>Who Is Officer Michael Fanone?
