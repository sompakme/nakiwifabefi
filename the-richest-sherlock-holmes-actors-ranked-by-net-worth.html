Arthur Conan Doyle, the mastermind creator of Sherlock Holmes, first introduced the character in the novelette <i>A Study In Scarlet</i> in 1887. The world’s only consulting detective, Doyle based Holmes’ mannerisms on his professor Dr. Joseph Bell from the University of Edinburgh. The character became famous from its first publication. The character's popularity has only grown since then, and many creators have adapted his adventures from the books into movies and television shows. Very few actors have bagged the role of the eccentric Sherlock Holmes, who entertains the audiences even today.&nbsp;<a href=#>The actors have made millions playing the iconic role</a> that has brought them into the spotlight. Let’s take a look at the net worth of the Sherlock Holmes actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=henry-cavill-40-million>Henry Cavill ($40 million)</h2><p>Henry Cavill has become a well-established action star, best known for his performance as Superman in the DCEU. Cavill has amassed a $40 million net worth working in television shows and movies. His most notable salaries include earning $14 million for <i>Man Of Steel</i>, including base pay and a portion of the box office earnings. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, Cavill was paid $400,000 per episode for the first season of the fantasy show <i>The Witcher</i>, and his salary was hiked to $1 million per episode in season two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Cavill ventured into the mystery crime genre when he joined the Netflix movie <i>Enola Holmes</i> cast as Sherlock Holmes. While actors have played Holmes as a self-obsessed, selfish yet brilliant detective, Cavill’s portrayal was a fresh take. <i>Enola Holmes</i> delved into the caring, concerned, and slightly more empathetic version of the world-famous detective loved by audiences. The movie was made on a $20 million budget and grossed $110 million in the United States and $216 million worldwide, becoming one of the most-watched Netflix original movies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Rules Henry Cavill Had To Follow To Become Superman</a></span></p><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch-40-million>Benedict Cumberbatch ($40 million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch, became famous after starring in <i>Sherlock</i></a> alongside Martin Freeman as Dr. John Watson for the BBC series. The show received rave reviews for the clever plot and stunning cast members that played their roles to perfection. Cumberbatch portrayed the role for four seasons from 2010 to 2017 and made $559,000 per season of the show, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>. While the show's fifth season was speculated to be in development, the creators, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have not confirmed the series for another season.</p><p>Benedict Cumberbatch went on to bag another high-profile role after playing Sherlock Holmes as Dr. Strange in the MCU. With a $40 million net worth, a notable portion of the earnings comes from his appearances in Marvel movies. The actor has donned the red clock for six movies to date and has earned hefty paychecks. For his standalone 2015 film <i>Dr. Strange</i>, Cumberbatch made $5.5 million, and for the 2022 <i>Dr. Strange: And The Multiverse Of Madness</i>, Cumberbatch is paid $7.5 million and an additional cut from the box office earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-300-million>Robert Downey Jr. ($300 million)</h2><p>Robert Downey Jr. has had the feat of starring in some of the highest-grossing movies of all time that made billions at the box office worldwide. While he will always be best known for portraying the Marvel superhero Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. has also starred as Sherlock Holmes. The actor was the consulting detective in two movies: <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in 2009 and <i>Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows</i> in 2011, earning $498.4 million and $535.6 million worldwide. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Downey was paid $15 million for starring in the 2011 Holmes sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The actor is also hailed as the creator of the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. His 2008 movie <i>Iron Man</i> launched a new phase of cinema that changed the history of superhero movies. Downey was only paid $500,000 for his first movie. However, his salaries increased with every passing film. He made $10 million for <i>Iron Man 2</i>, $50 million for <i>The Avengers</i>, $80 million for <i>Avengers: Age Of Ultron</i>, and $75 million each for <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>. His salaries have included base pay and back-end profits from the box office collection.</p><p>Henry Cavill, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Robert Downey Jr. have enchanted audiences with their eccentric performances of the notorious detective while bringing a version of themselves into the roles. While Downey and Cumberbatch may not be reprising their roles any time soon, Henry Cavill will return for <i>Enola Holmes 2</i>, set for a 2022 release on Netflix.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Care Jordan: The 10 Most Expensive Philanthropic Ventures Of Michael Jordan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMq6CcoJWowW6%2Fx56ppaeToHqpu8umnKxlkZjBsL7SZqmappuasW6u2GalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-richest-sherlock-holmes-actors-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-richest-sherlock-holmes-actors-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-richest-sherlock-holmes-actors-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-richest-sherlock-holmes-actors-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-richest-sherlock-holmes-actors-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-richest-sherlock-holmes-actors-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-jeffrey-dahmer-deaf-victim-tony-hughes-dahmer-where-is-tony-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-jeffrey-dahmer-deaf-victim-tony-hughes-dahmer-where-is-tony-now.html>What Happened To Jeffrey Dahmer Deaf Victim: Tony Hughes Dahmer?
