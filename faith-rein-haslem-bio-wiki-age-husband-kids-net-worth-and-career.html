He played college basketball for the Florida Gators, where he was a key member of four NCAA tournament teams.</strong></p><p>Haslem began his professional career in France with Chalon-sur-Saône and then signed with his hometown Miami Heat in 2003. He has won 3 NBA championships while playing for the Heat.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faith-rein-haslem-age></span><span>Faith Rein-Haslem Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Faith</strong> is <strong>39 years old as of 2020</strong>, she was born on <strong>7 April 1981 in Miami, Florida</strong>, United States of America. She celebrates her <strong>birthday</strong> on <strong>7 April</strong> every year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faith-rein-haslem-height></span><span>Faith Rein-Haslem Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Faith </b>stands at an&nbsp;<strong>average height</strong>&nbsp;and has&nbsp;<strong>moderate weight</strong>. She appears to be quite tall in stature if her photos, relative to her surroundings, are anything to go by. However, details regarding her actual height and other body measurements are currently not publicly available. We are keeping tabs and will update this information once it is out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faith-rein-haslem-education></span><span>Faith Rein-Haslem Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faith has never shared any information concerning her educational background nor her qualifications with the public. However, this information will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faith-rein-haslem-family></span><span>Faith Rein-Haslem Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Faith</strong> was born and raised by her parents in<strong> Miami, Florida</strong>. Our efforts to find out more about her family came to no avail as no such information is publicly available. Thus, the identity of Faith’s parents is still unclear. It is also not known if she has any siblings. Nevertheless, this section will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faith-rein-haslem-husband-and-kids></span><span>Faith Rein-Haslem Husband and Kids</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Faith</strong> is married to <strong>Udonis Haslem</strong>, a famous National Basketball Association player (NBA) who plays for Miami Heat and a former Florida Gators player.</p><p>Udonis met Rein in 1999 while attending the University of Florida, where she was a member of the Florida Gators track and field team. They dated for <strong>fourteen years</strong> and later tied the knot in <strong>2013</strong>. They are blessed with three children, <strong>Kedonis Haslem, Josiah Haslem, and Elijah Haslem</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faith-rein-haslem-husband-udonis-haslem-defeat-the-bubble></span><span>Faith Rein-Haslem Husband Udonis Haslem Defeat the Bubble</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Udonis Haslem has played just once since the Miami Heat have been on the Disney World campus for the NBA restart, and that was in a meaningless game against Indiana. Every other player on the team made multiple appearances since the season came back in late July, including two-way players Kyle Alexander and Gabe Vincent.</p><p>It was just the 81st game Haslem has played in the past five seasons. Now 40 years old, Haslem remains the Heat’s captain, but after a career defined by the triumph of hard work over adversity Haslem was undrafted out of Florida in 2002 but stuck around with the Heat for 17 years he has become more of a de facto assistant coach, an extension of head coach Erik Spoelstra, and an enforcer should fellow players get out of line.</p><p>In the NBA’s so-called “bubble” environment, created to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection, that job has gained in importance. Haslem understood quickly that for the Heat, throughout the NBA restart, there would be two opponents: whomever the team was facing and the repetitive grind of the bubble situation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faith-rein-haslem-net-worth></span><span>Faith Rein-Haslem Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Faith Haslem</strong> has an estimated net worth between <strong>$100,000 dollars to $500, 000 dollars</strong>.
