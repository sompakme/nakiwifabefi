Blue Ivy was there to support her beautiful Mom as she achieved yet another significant milestone in a long and successful career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blue Ivy probably loved it when Jay-Z joined Beyoncé onstage that night.&nbsp;Few children have two extremely famous parents. While it's awesome in a way, there is a real downside. Blue Ivy will have the child star experience whether she wants it or not. Today, we're going to weigh the pros and cons of being "American royalty".</p><p>Blue Ivy has fame by association and she'll never be anonymous.&nbsp;Born on the 7th of January, 2012, Blue Ivy is a Capricorn. This is a zodiac sign that prefers to scale the heights, career-wise. It's also a sign that tends to get hit with depression now and then. Blue Ivy is likely to pursue success in an ambitious way, but she may be shaken by the hard knocks along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She'll always be compared to her celebrity parents.&nbsp;This cute little girl is innocent. She's not someone that anyone should hate on. However, this doesn't stop people from throwing shade. While most people are sweet about Blue Ivy, many have gotten catty about her looks. That kind of unwanted, unsolicited feedback is not going to stop and Blue Ivy will see at least some of it, which is a shame. Kids need to build self-esteem and seeing criticism from strangers doesn't make it easy.</p><p>Now, let's talk about what Blue Ivy can brag about...and what she'll never get to do.</p><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-shushed-beyonc-and-jay--z>Bragging Rights - She Shushed Beyoncé and Jay -Z</h2><p>Blue Ivy has the power. She can control&nbsp;Beyoncé and Jay-Z. At the 2018 Grammy's, she wanted Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter and Shawn Corey Carter to cool it with the clapping and emoting during a speech by Camila Cabello.</p><p>The speech by Cabella focused on the DACA program. It was about protecting America's "Dreamers". Cabello's speech seemed to resonate with Blue Ivy. She made a now-famous "calm down" hand gesture to her Mom, but the little girl had a pleasant expression on her face while she did it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One gets the sense that Jay-Z was being a bit too extra for Blue Ivy, too. He got a more subtle version of the same command.</p><p>I watched Blue Ivy give the command while sitting with my son. He now uses the command when I'm getting a bit extra. It's hilarious and I'm grateful to Blue Ivy, because the hand gesture is now a running joke in our family.</p><p>I am a mother and I can say with certainty that our children do control us. We will very often do what they want. It's cute to watch Blue Ivy's famous parents act like normal parents. Quite possibly, they are wrapped around Blue Ivy's finger.&nbsp;Beyoncé stopped clapping immediately once she saw Blue Ivy's hand gesture. Jay-Z got real quiet, too.</p><p>I would usually think that this kind of conduct from a child was bratty, but I actually thought it was funny and charming. I have noticed from other photos and video that Blue Ivy adores her mommy and daddy. The hand gesture was about enforcing proper decorum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, Blue Ivy is a stickler for social decorum. That already sets her apart from a legion of famous offspring.</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-ll-never-be-non-famous>Never Get to Do - She'll Never Be Non-Famous</h2><p>Blue Ivy was born in the spotlight. She might as well have been born on a Broadway stage, with a full crowd of spectators in the seats. Shakespeare said, "All the world's a stage". For people like Blue Ivy, this is so true. It's a sad fact of life that celebrity offspring are hardly ever offstage.</p><p>Most little babies don't have paparazzi fighting for pictures of them. Most little girls don't get hounded by photographers whenever they go out with Mom and Dad. Most little girls don't have strangers commenting on their resemblances to their fathers in mean and mocking ways.</p><p>Blue Ivy has been thrown into celebrity without her consent. How she will handle it is anyone's guess, but I'm supportive of her and hope she'll have a great life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The saving grace of the situation is that she's never known anything else. She has never not been famous. For her,&nbsp;fame is normal. I'm sure her parents give her lots of time to be herself in the family home, away from the media glare.</p><p>According to Popsugar.com, the Carter family divides its time between a Bel Air mansion and a Tribeca loft. They also take some dazzling vacations to tropical locales.</p><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-s-the-daughter-of-sasha-fierce>Bragging Rights - She's the Daughter of Sasha Fierce</h2><p>Ok,&nbsp;Beyoncé is so not average. When Beyoncé decides to unleash the beast, her alter ego, Sasha Fierce, emerges...and no one can look away.</p><p>Imagine having&nbsp;Beyoncé for a mother! Remember how she bashed out a car window with a baseball bat in the Hold Up video? She was wearing a yellow dress by Roberto Cavalli? Every negative emotion and trauma she had, she expressed with each swipe of her baseball bat. Every time she swung the bat, it was like she exorcised another demon and gained personal power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyway, that was quite a video. Lemonade as a whole was pretty stunning in terms of its emotional authenticity and visual impact. I'm more of an alt-rock person, but even I could see that Lemonade was a work of art.</p><p>Beyoncé is a powerhouse. She's like King Midas. If she touches it, it's suddenly gold. There's something almost magical about the enduring appeal of&nbsp;Beyoncé. Blue Ivy's Mom creates the illusion that success is so easy. It is an illusion. Behind the scenes, she's a perfectionist who is working extremely hard to entertain us.</p><p>Blue Ivy has a powerful mother who is a role model. She should be very proud of her Mom and I'm sure she is very proud.</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-ll-never-avoid-comparisons-with-mom>Never Get to Do - She'll Never Avoid Comparisons with Mom</h2><p>Imagine loving your wonderful Mom so much, but getting so sick of being compared with her? When you imagine that, you'll probably be imagining Blue Ivy's future! I'm not even talking about comparisons which are centered on physical appearance, although those comparisons happen every day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I'm talking about being compared with&nbsp;Beyoncé's achievements and legacy.</p><p>Beyoncé wins a slew of awards and her fans are so rabid that they are called the Beyhive. Beyhive members will swarm the foes of their heroine, if only online. They will fight for the Queen Bee/Bey.</p><p>Beyoncé is one of the biggest celebrities on the planet.&nbsp;Beyoncé must play the role of&nbsp;Beyoncé/Sasha Fierce in public and then cool it down by being a typical Mom in private.</p><p>I was thinking about how keyed up&nbsp;Beyoncé must be after huge performances like her headlining gig at Coachella 2018. Her daughter was in the crowd. When&nbsp;Beyoncé steps off the stage, she probably sees her little girl soon afterward, and&nbsp;Beyoncé has to be a mother, rather than a big star who is flooded with adrenaline.</p><p>It must be tough for&nbsp;Beyoncé to switch lanes sometimes. Not that&nbsp;Beyoncé can't handle challenges. She probably makes the switch from star to Mom better than most.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blue Ivy will always be in her Mom's shadow. It's rare that kids become more famous and influential than their celeb parents. I'm trying to think of times when it's happened. I've got nothing.</p><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-s-the-daughter-of-jay-z>Bragging Rights - She's the Daughter of Jay-Z</h2><p>Jay-Z is a rapper that other rappers idolize. He's also an inspiration to entrepreneurs all over the world. Jay-Z was raised by a single mom in the rough Marcy projects of Brooklyn, New York. He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. What he wanted, he worked to get. He soared from the mean streets of the Big Apple to packed-out stadiums where everyone was chanting his name. That's quite an ascent, isn't it?</p><p>Jay-Z's lyrics are frank and honest. He is who he is:&nbsp;"This is the number one rule for your set/&nbsp;In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what regrets could a man like Jay-Z have? Well, his Dad left his family when Jay-Z (then Shawn Carter) was just eleven years old and Jay-Z definitely has a lot of negative feelings about that. Jay-Z also got sucked into the thug life in his neighborhood. By his own admission, he sold substances for cold, hard cash. He may regret that, too. Also, he regrets being unfaithful to Beyoncé. Let's hope he regrets it enough to not do it anymore.</p><p>Powerful people always have skeletons rattling around in their closets. Sometimes, other people open the closet doors and let the skeletons out. Overall, Jay-Z has achieved incredible success without connections or money. He made it all happen for himself. Blue Ivy's Dad is a mogul and a master musician.</p><p>My son and I saw him in concert recently. He danced on a criss-cross arrangement of bright laser light that touched the stage. He had complete control of the crowd. His energy was positive and confident. He is very powerful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-ll-never-avoid-comparisons-with-dad>Never Get to Do - She'll Never Avoid Comparisons with Dad</h2><p>There's obviously an upside to being the daughter of Jay-Z. The obvious perks include fame, money, and influence. So, what's the downside? Well, it's about being compared with him. Blue Ivy does seem musically inclined and may very well have inherited musical talent from both parents. If she tries to make music as an adult, it'll be compared to her Dad's (Mom's too, of course). Will Blue Ivy measure up?</p><p>It must be daunting for celeb kids of musical stars to put out music of their own. Critics are going to pick it apart. Fans of both parents are going to listen to it and decide if it's as good as Mom and Dad's, or worse. People are going to assume that the celeb child got a record contract without needing to do much real work to get it and they'll probably be assuming correctly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone wants respect, no matter who they are. It's a human need. Celeb offspring often have difficulty earning respect. With a Dad as powerful and influential as Jay-Z, there's going to be harsh comparisons. Blue Ivy may decide to stay away from recording music as an adult because she doesn't want to deal with it. On the other hand, she may want to prove herself by producing amazing music.</p><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-s-the-older-sister-of-twins>Bragging Rights - She's the Older Sister of Twins</h2><p>Blue Ivy had Mom and Dad all to herself for quite a while. Things changed on the 13th of June, 2017, when Mom and Dad welcomed twins, Sir and Rumi, into the world. Now, Blue Ivy gets to brag about being the older sister of boy and girl twins.</p><p>The twins were born a few seconds apart. Now, Blue Ivy has a brother and sister to love. While she might feel a bit of jealousy sometimes, she's probably thrilled to have siblings, as siblings tend to add a lot of spice to life. They are there to play with, laugh with and argue with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blue Ivy was five years old when her siblings were born.&nbsp;If you're into astrology, the twins were born under the sign of Gemini. The symbol of Gemini is "the twins". Gemini isn't compatible with Blue Ivy's sign, Capricorn, so there may be tension between the Carter kids in the future.</p><p>Blue Ivy will be the bossy one and the younger siblings will be more social and glib. Capricorns are serious and can be insecure. Geminis are social butterflies who tend to scatter their energies. Geminis have tons of talents and have trouble settling down and applying themselves sometimes.</p><p>Beyoncé is a Virgo, so she's most compatible, family-wise, with Blue Ivy. They are both Earth signs. The twins will be more compatible with Sagittarius dad, Jay-Z.</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-ll-never-look-just-like-mom>Never Get to Do - She'll Never Look Just Like Mom</h2><p>I think Blue Ivy is really cute. I also think she looks exactly like her Dad, although maybe there is some resemblance to her mother, especially around the eyes. Her eyebrows are quite a bit like her Mom's. Blue Ivy is not going to be a carbon copy of her Mom and a lot of people seemed to want her to be that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She shouldn't feel that she's disappointed people because of her genetics. I find that many girls take after their Dads. Blue Ivy looks exactly the way that she's supposed to and I think she'll look amazing&nbsp;as a grown up. She will develop her own style and refine it. She already seems to have a lot of confidence. Confidence is attractive.</p><p>There may be times when Blue Ivy wishes that she could look like Mom.&nbsp;Beyoncé basically looks like a Disney princess. Everyone talks about how great&nbsp;Beyoncé looks. While&nbsp;Beyoncé has had to take some criticism when her weight has fluctuated or she has worn something questionable, she is generally considered to be gorgeous beyond belief.</p><p>Blue Ivy surely already knows that she doesn't look a lot like Mom. In the end, it might be a blessing to not be a mini-me of&nbsp;Beyoncé. It might make it easier for Blue Ivy to carve out her own identity as a woman when she's older.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-has-an-amazing-wardrobe>Bragging Rights - She Has An Amazing Wardrobe</h2><p>Should little girls have designer clothes from the most coveted fashion houses in the world? Is this spoiling them or loving them? In Blue Ivy's case, it makes sense that she always wears the very best, or what most people perceive as the very best.</p><p>If she didn't wear amazing clothes from high-end designers, she'd be out of place in the family. I mean, the Carters are rich.</p><p>According to the British Vogue website, Beyoncé and Jay-Z make sure that Blue Ivy dresses like a princess. For example, she went to the VMAs and she and her Mom were all decked out in high fashion that sparkled and shimmered. Blue Ivy wore a dress from Mischka Aoki to the event which supposedly was worth eleven thousand dollars. She accessorized with a tiara and shoes from Giuseppe Zanotti. Her gorgeous mom won eight awards that evening.</p><p>For an outing to a basketball game with the family, Blue Ivy threw a jean jacket over a dress from Gucci which was valued at two thousand bucks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as personal style goes, you may need to wait a while until you see the true style of Blue Ivy, because she reportedly has her own stylist. When she's older, we may see more of her personality in her outfits, but the little girl probably already gets to pick and choose from some expensive options.</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-won-t-get-to-succeed-on-her-own-merits>Never Get to Do - She Won't Get to Succeed on Her Own Merits</h2><p>Is it possible for a celeb offspring like Blue Ivy to make it on their own? Maybe if they choose careers which are completely different from the careers of their famous parents. Even then, there's a chance that people are going to hand them opportunities because of their famous families. Kids from famous families are going to get special treatment. Of course, they'll also need to read horrible things about themselves online and have to deal with people who want things from them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Blue Ivy decides to be a doctor or an astronaut or an organic farmer or something, she may be able to escape accusations that she's achieving things based on merit. It'll be hard for her to distinguish herself and prove herself. If she goes into music, or modeling or acting, or handbag design, or something that is a typical career for children of celebs, it's safe to say that most people won't believe that she earned any success that she gets on her own.</p><p>Some children of celebrities move past it all and become respected in their own right. For example, fashion designer, Stella McCartney, created the evening wedding dress of Meghan Markle, who is now the Duchess of Sussex. Stella is the daughter of former Beatle, Paul McCartney. Stella has been achieving in the fashion world for so long that I don't really associate her with her father anymore. I think of her as a great designer. Maybe Blue Ivy will achieve similar success. The odds are stacked against Blue Ivy, but anything is possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-s-an-heiress>Bragging Rights - She's an Heiress</h2><p>This is "The Richest", so let's talk money. Blue Ivy is an heiress. She will inherit from both loving parents someday. Hopefully, not for a very long time. Let's start with Jay-Z. Obviously, both of Blue Ivy's parents have healthy bank accounts!</p><p>According to Time.com, Jay-Z has a 2018 net worth of $810 million dollars. Blue Ivy's mom has a net worth of&nbsp;$350 million dollars. This means that Mom and Dad are a billionaire couple.</p><p>We're talking massive money. Blue Ivy's parents are seriously loaded. Most people don't know what it's like to have more money than they can spend. The money that makes Blue Ivy an heiress comes from so many different places. Beyoncé and Jay-Z have so many different streams of income, from music to merchandise to side deals like fashion. It's just a mountain of money...a Matterhorn of cash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How do Blue Ivy's parents spend their money? There are homes in California and New York. Jay-Z owns a private jet which is a Challenger 850. Its luxurious interior features leather furnishings in cream.&nbsp;Beyoncé reportedly drops seventy-five hundred bucks a month on a live-in chef. Yeah, I'd do the same. Good for her.</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-ll-never-go-out-without-security>Never Get to Do - She'll Never Go Out Without Security</h2><p>Since she is the heiress of billionaire parents who are also famous enough to attract creeps who are obsessed with them, Blue Ivy is a little girl who needs 24/7 security. When she's older, she may manage to break free from security, but would it be safe for her to do so?</p><p>According to Essence.com, Blue Ivy has her own bodyguard. She's also got the stylist, the chef, etc. Blue Ivy's bodyguard is named Julius de Boer and he's omnipresent. He guards the whole family.</p><p>According to the website of his security firm, the bodyguard is an Amsterdam native who got into protecting VIPs when he was 24 years old. He's educated, with a degree in Psychology. His security company has branches in New York, London, and Abu Dhabi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You may recognize Julius because he was in the elevator when Beyoncé's sister, Solange, physically attacked Jay-Z. She reportedly went nuts because Jay-Z was flirting with another lady in Beyoncé's presence. Solange acted fast, so Julius must have been surprised.</p><p>It's good that Julius is looking after Blue Ivy and her parents. He knows five languages, he does pre-planning before going places with the family and generally uses all of his intellect and experience to keep them safe.</p><p>Most children do not have bodyguards. The fact that Blue Ivy has security shows just how abnormal her childhood is.</p><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-has-an-unusual-name>Bragging Rights - She Has an Unusual Name</h2><p>According to the Heart.co.uk website, Blue Ivy got her unusual name because her Mom loved the novel, "A Field Guide to Getting Lost". Beyoncé posted an excerpt from the book to her own Tumblr account. The excerpt is an ode to the color blue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The author of "A Field Guide to Getting Lost" describes the color blue as, "the light that gets lost", which "gives us the beauty of the world". The author also wrote:&nbsp;"the world is blue at its edges and in its depths"</p><p>Pretty words. I have to confess, I didn't know until now why Blue Ivy got her name. Blue is a gorgeous color. Midnight blue, pale blue, turquoise...it's all good.&nbsp;Now, we know why Blue Ivy can be proud of her offbeat name. So, how about her siblings? The twins have unusual names, too.</p><p>Rumi isn't too hard to figure out. When I heard that the new Carter baby girl was called Rumi, I realized it was probably because of the poet, Rumi, who lived in Persia during the 13th Century. Some Googling showed me that I was on the right track. Jay-Z said that their baby boy just looked like a "sir" when they saw him. He apparently had an air of nobility!</p><p>I love how they named the boy, Sir, because it means that everyone will defer to their son just by saying his name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-won-t-have-private-romances>Never Get to Do - She Won't Have Private Romances</h2><p>Little Blue Ivy is way too young for romance. When she does get old enough to date, she'll need to accept the fact that the press will be dogging her and her new love interest. It's possible that she can keep things private, but it will be tough. She'd basically have to hide out and never go out in public with her boyfriend. So, Blue Ivy is going to have to adjust to the fact that she'll likely never have a love life which is truly private. That does suck.</p><p>Blue Ivy goes to an elite school right now. I don't want to name it, even though the information is out there online, because she has little enough privacy as it is. She's a child. When it's time for her to date, she'll probably be at another elite school, which means that she's probably going to date someone from a rich background which is similar to hers. It'll be a Gossip Girl type of upbringing. She will be a rich girl at a rich kid school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Blue Ivy break the mold and date someone from a different background? Remember, Jay-Z came from the Brooklyn projects! Would Blue Ivy's Dad be ok with her dating someone who wasn't privileged? I guess we'll find out if that scenario does come to pass. I can't see the press leaving Blue Ivy alone during her teens and beyond.</p><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-s-been-on-the-billboard-chart-already>Bragging Rights - She's Been on the Billboard Chart Already</h2><p>When Blue Ivy hit the Billboard chart, she was the youngest person to ever land on it! Blue Ivy was featured on her father's track, "Glory". In 2012, Blue Ivy, who was a newborn at the time, joined her father on the Billboard chart.</p><p>The track was labeled as "Jay-Z featuring B.I.C". Of course, "B.I.C" stands for Blue Ivy Carter. So, what did Blue Ivy do on the track, "Glory"? Well, the 1st seconds of her life were recorded and then used on the track, so you can hear her crying, cooing and breathing. The song was a big hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jay-Z showed a real sentimental streak when he put his newborn daughter on the track. While I put together this list, I saw a lot of pics of him with Blue Ivy and it looks like he completely adores her. It's kind of sweet, actually, as he's supposed to be the tough guy. His daughter is cute and so much like him. He seems very taken with her.</p><p>I wonder if more collaborations are in the cards? For sure, Jay-Z will help his daughter if she wants to record entire mixtapes, etc. He will have her back if she wishes to get creative in a recording studio.</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-won-t-make-friends-without-wondering-if-they-re-using-her>Never Get to Do - She Won't Make Friends Without Wondering If They're Using Her</h2><p>This is probably the thing that is going to be hardest for Blue Ivy. She'll have people trying to make friends with her because they want to be around her famous parents, want Blue Ivy's money or just want gossip about the Carters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is why rich kids tend to go to school with other rich kids. Their parents are trying to protect them from kids who aren't wealthy and may want to use them. The rich parents pay a fortune to educate their kids at elite schools in order to try and keep them safe from those who may want to take advantage of them. It's not just to get them impressive educations.</p><p>Not sure if sequestering rich kids with famous parents in elite schools really stops them from encountering users, but it might help.</p><p>A public school might be a difficult place for a child as famous as Blue Ivy. I do understand why very famous and rich parents choose private schools for their kids. The problem with sending a rich kid to a rich kid school is that the child will not really spend time with regular people. There may be some scholarship students, but most of the kids at the school will be one percenters. These schools may promote a sense of entitlement in students.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-s-a-rapper>Bragging Rights - She's a Rapper</h2><p>In January of 2018, according to the People.com website, Jay-Z made an animated video for his little girl on the occasion of her sixth birthday. The video was called, "Blue's Freestyle" and it featured his daughter's rap, from his own 4:44 record.</p><p>The video was cute. It's about a talent show at a school and shows a cartoon version of Blue Ivy standing in the wings, waiting to do a ballet routine onstage. Her celeb parents are there to watch her do ballet and so are the twins. In the video, Blue does some of the ballet moves and then decides to start rapping instead. Naturally, a mic drops down to her right before she switches over to freestyle.</p><p>I checked out this video on YouTube and some commentators felt that Blue Ivy had better lyrical capability than Lil Yachty and Uzi Vert. Here's one verse from her freestyle rap:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everything, Everything, this my only single thing, everything I hear is my answer and if you think I say then innocent if I say? I never hear that, I be in the posse, never seen a ceiling in my whole life, everything I seen, everything is rotten, never sit in silence innocent is carter, innocent we seek them, then I send a peak in everything I feed and everything I read, boom shakalaka boom shakalaka"</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-ll-never-be-an-only-child-again>Never Get to Do - She'll Never Be An Only Child Again</h2><p>Is it fun to be an only child? I'm not an only child, so I'm not sure, but it's probably got its pros and cons. On the plus side, it does mean attention. Blue Ivy was an only child until she was five. That's a nice, long run.</p><p>Overall, I think it's better for her to have siblings. They will always be there for her. She'll be able to rely on them throughout her life. It's possible that Blue Ivy feels jealous sometimes, because the twins are getting a lot of attention, but I doubt her jealousy is too extreme. There isn't just one baby; there are two. Plus, twins tend to attract attention because they are twins. Blue Ivy will need to accept that the twins are going to get the spotlight sometimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Any parent could tell Blue Ivy that the first baby is always going to be extremely important. Blue Ivy probably feels loved all of the time anyway. When parents spend years babying the first child and then have another, the parents are still totally adoring of the first child. The bond that has been created is very strong. It's rock solid.</p><p>Although tabloid stories have reported that Blue Ivy is super-jealous of Sir and Rumi, Beyonce's Mom, Tina Knowles, has said that Blue Ivy is a good big sister to the babies. The story about Blue Ivy being really jealous was debunked at Gossipcop.com.</p><h2 id=bragging-rights---she-goes-to-an-elite-private-school>Bragging Rights - She Goes to an Elite Private School</h2><p>Blue Ivy is doing the Gossip Girl school thing. She's attending an elite school that is off-limits to a lot of poorer kids, unless they score scholarships or something like that. Obviously, she's very young and probably doesn't have a lot of say in terms of how she is educated. It is up to Mom and Dad to make these decisions for her. Her school is as good as you'd imagine. It costs about twenty grand per year to go there. The school is on the West Coast, it's not in NYC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, Jay-Z and Beyoncé actually moved so that their daughter could go to this school. It's also been reported that they are very involved at the school. This is nice to hear. Jay-Z and&nbsp;Beyoncé decided to focus more on Los Angeles so their daughter could have stability during her school years. That's a solid parenting decision. Kids who flit from place to place with their parents often miss out on the comfort of day-to-day routines that are predictable. Blue Ivy will still have the luxury vacations. Lucky her.</p><p>Blue Ivy seems extremely bright, if her rap lyrics are any indication. So, I'm sure she'll thrive academically. Mom and Dad aren't exactly average and Blue Ivy is likely to have one heck of an intellect.</p><h2 id=never-get-to-do---she-will-know-what-her-dad-did>Never Get to Do - She Will Know what her dad did</h2><p>Now, here comes the hard stuff. If you were following along online during the whole "Becky with the good hair" scandal that erupted after Beyoncé released Lemonade, you may already know that many people thought that Rachel Roy was the "other woman" who was causing trouble in Bey's marriage!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel Roy used to be married to Damon Dash, who was once Jay-Z's business partner.</p><p>The Beyhive went after Rachel online. She received scathing comments and generally got trashed in the press. Only Bey, Rachel, and Jay-Z know what really happened. Blue Ivy is getting to the age where she can read things online. Her parent's marriage problems are going to something that she has to confront, if she hasn't already. Interestingly, Rachel Roy was in attendance the night that Solange freaked out on Jay-Z in the elevator. According to an USmagazine.com report, Solange shouted at Rachel before the elevator meltdown.</p><p>Jay-Z's admitted to wrongdoing. I tend to think that once someone does that, they stay that way. I feel some people are just wired that way. Maybe Jay-Z is different, though. He is publicly contrite for what he did to his wife. However, celebs do put on masks in public which doesn't always match their private faces. Time will tell if Jay-Z has really changed his ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Wikipedia.com, People.com, Vanityfair.com, Popsugar.com, Vogue.co.uk, Time.com, Essence.com, Heart.co.uk, Gossipcop.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpYGLBqbXNoKpmmpyqsm611bJksKGcoXqiuNaasKxlmJbDpnnBq5ign5mjtG6%2ByKCfratdqbxufY9mqqGdnKF6r7HVnqlmn5WperW7jJ2maA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-things-blue-ivy-will-always-have-bragging-rights-to-10-she-ll-never-get-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-things-blue-ivy-will-always-have-bragging-rights-to-10-she-ll-never-get-to-do.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-things-blue-ivy-will-always-have-bragging-rights-to-10-she-ll-never-get-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-things-blue-ivy-will-always-have-bragging-rights-to-10-she-ll-never-get-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-things-blue-ivy-will-always-have-bragging-rights-to-10-she-ll-never-get-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-things-blue-ivy-will-always-have-bragging-rights-to-10-she-ll-never-get-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20-celebs-that-refuse-to-work-together-no-matter-how-much-they-re-paid.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20-celebs-that-refuse-to-work-together-no-matter-how-much-they-re-paid.html>20 Celebs That Refuse To Work Together (No Matter How Much They're Paid)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-mack-lovat-and-what-happened-between-him-and-farrah-abraham.html>Who Is Mack Lovat And What Happened Between Him And Farrah Abraham?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-mack-lovat-and-what-happened-between-him-and-farrah-abraham.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
