The series followed Ellen Morgan (played by <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>) and her friends navigating life in Los Angeles. At the start of season two, the title changed to Ellen and a new cast was assembled. The show made DeGeneres a star and made history with its special coming out episode in the fourth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After season five, the show was canceled. Many cite the backlash <a href=#>DeGeneres</a> received from her coming out to be the reason. In the years since the show ended, many place particular emphasis on the history-making coming out episode.</p><p>However, the rest of the cast was special and crucial to the show's success as well. What have they done since the sitcom came to an end?</p><h2 id=jack-plotnick><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jack Plotnick</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack Plotnick played the role of Barrett on the show. His character was one half of the frequently seen gay couple on the show, whom Ellen was friends with. He is best known for his role in Gods and Monsters, a 1998 period drama where he played the role of Edmund Kay. Since Ellen, Plotnick has found other roles, such as the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Drawn Together.

His character first appeared as a fellow volunteer at a call center where Ellen worked. His character became a recurring role on the show in later seasons.

He also appeared in the show The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.</p><h2 id=jeremy-piven><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jeremy Piven</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeremy Piven played the role of Ellen's cousin Spence on the show. He was brought in to fill the void left by the character of Adam (played by Arye Gross), who exited the show in the third season. Spence's rougher demeanor contrasted Ellen's kind nature. This made for brilliant comedic moments between the two. Piven later found success as the agent Ari Gold in the hit HBO series Entourage. He was nominated for <a href=#>Best Supporting Actor at the Emmys</a> for four consecutive years, winning in three of them. He was later accused of assault by several women in 2017 and 2018. <a href=#>Piven denied all the allegations</a>.</p><h2 id=alice-hirson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alice Hirson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alice Hirson played Ellen's mother, Lois Morgan. Lois was an endearing character and her butting heads with Ellen always made for great comedy.

She played the character of Jenny Jackson, the mother of Annie Camden, played by Catherine Hicks. She had a recurring role in The Secret Life of the American Teenager as well as guest spots on Law & Order, ER, NYPD Blue, Judging Amy, Just Shoot Me!, and Cold Case.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Child Prodigies That Ellen DeGeneres Had On Her Show...
