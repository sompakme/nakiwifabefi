In February 2024, she made impressive moves in her <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>career, winning a Grammy and announcing a new album. Fans of <a href=#>Swift's many popular songs</a> were thrilled to hear the news. That same month, her <strong>Kansas City Chiefs tight end</strong> boyfriend won the Super Bowl and the pair got even more exposure.</p><p>The couple is a fascinating match since they are both equally beloved... and incredibly wealthy. <a href=#>Kelce is known for spending his massive net worth</a> and <a href=#>Swift is now a billionaire</a>. Besides talking about how rich and famous they are, fans can't help but notice that Taylor Swift has seemed pretty award when attending Kelce's games. In this article, we'll take a look at what people have said about her behavior, along with some of the criticism he has received in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-think-taylor-swift-looks-awkward-during-travis-kelce-39-s-nfl-games>Fans Think Taylor Swift Looks Awkward During Travis Kelce's NFL Games</h2><p>While of course Taylor Swift wants to support her boyfriend Travis Kelce, many are perhaps surprised that she has been such a permanent fixture at his NFL games. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, and there have been many moments when fans think that she looks super awkward and uncomfortable.</p><p>For instance, people shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video of Swift getting mad</a> about a play during a <strong>Kansas City Chiefs vs. New England Patriots game</strong> in December 2023. Many news outlets picked up on the story, and the singer seemed to mouth the "f" word. Since Swift is such a huge star and people are watching her every move at football games, this wasn't the best look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/everything-catching-kelce-revealed-about-what-travis-is-like-as-a-boyfriend.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another uncomfortable video of Swift got lots of attention. According to Buzzfeed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift poked fun at Kelce's behavior</a> on the field. She made a "bro" gesture when talking to her friend Blake Lively, who was in the stands with her. People took notice of this and some felt that there was too much attention on Swift, not on the game itself.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t095022-884.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's relationship with her dad and mom and their separation was the inspiration for some her best songs, including 'The Best Day'.</span><p>ESPN also reported that Swift and Patrick Mahomes's wife Brittany Mahomes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>danced during a game</strong></a>. Domonique Foxworth and Dan Graziano said the dance was "awkward" and mentioned that included chest bumps. There's no doubt that this moment stood out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/how-much-money-did-taylor-swift-make-the-nfl-after-their-most-watched-super-bowl-ever_-front-deposit-back-nfl_youtube.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift looked the most uncomfortable, however, when Travis Kelce made a speech and included the<strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lyrics to the Elvis song "Viva Las Vegas."</a> </strong>She didn't smile and had a serious expression on her face. Dr. Louise Mahler, who is a body language expert, spoke to Yahoo! and said:</p><p>"We can imagine how anyone super excited may have expressed themselves like this, but I think she was horrified, slightly amused, but embarrassed."</p><p>Mahler continued that Swift's behavior when other musicians win Grammy awards is different as she laughs and seems thrilled. But, in this case, she didn't appear to be happy.</p><p>Mahler said:</p><p>"In this footage, she opens, then shuts and holds her mouth tightly. She does not want to open it, suggesting she does not want to say something. Her mouth is slightly smiling, but her eyes lose their sparkle. She is being polite."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_how-travis-kelce-handles-the-pressures-that-comes-with-dating-taylor-swift_bk_a1_v2.jpg><p>Fans noticed how unhappy the singer looked and discussed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the memorable moment on Reddit</a>.

She looked at Brittany Mahomes, who she was with, and people think that she said, "I knew this was coming."

His tweet about squirrels got the most attention: "I just gave a squirle a peice of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy." While he didn't say anything insulting or offensive, fans couldn't help but laugh at his awkward comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:16</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-isn-t-the-only-artist-who-has-turned-down-the-super-bowl-halftime-show-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Isn't The Only Artist Who Has Turned Down The Super Bowl Halftime Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift isn't the only musician who has turned down the Super Bowl Halftime Show, with other big-name artists also saying no to the gig.</span><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelce talked about the tweets</a> on his New Heights podcast that he co-hosts with his brother Jason. He said, "I was just like using Twitter as like a diary. I'm just out here saying nonsense."</p><p>That wasn't the only time that Kelce got attention, of course. Also in 2023, he said on his podcast:</p><p>“I’m gonna find a breeder and I’m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again."</p><p>Swift's fans didn't love hearing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelce's "breeders" comment</a> and many would call it problematic.</p><p>While there has been a lot of negative attention on Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's relationship, as of this writing, they still seem happy to be together. It seems very likely that Swift will keep attending as many NFL games as she can as long as she continues to date the athlete.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYruwwMicnJ1lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapeqLDyrCYq5xdrLa1tIytqZqumah6rLHLnJysZZKWsW6uxKGYr6Gfp3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffans-noticed-taylor-swift-looking-completely-out-of-place-amid-travis-kelce-s-bro-ish-behavior.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffans-noticed-taylor-swift-looking-completely-out-of-place-amid-travis-kelce-s-bro-ish-behavior.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffans-noticed-taylor-swift-looking-completely-out-of-place-amid-travis-kelce-s-bro-ish-behavior.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffans-noticed-taylor-swift-looking-completely-out-of-place-amid-travis-kelce-s-bro-ish-behavior.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffans-noticed-taylor-swift-looking-completely-out-of-place-amid-travis-kelce-s-bro-ish-behavior.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffans-noticed-taylor-swift-looking-completely-out-of-place-amid-travis-kelce-s-bro-ish-behavior.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lana-del-rey-tells-us-about-her-off-duty-athleisure-style.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lana-del-rey-tells-us-about-her-off-duty-athleisure-style.html>Lana Del Rey Tells Us About Her Off-Duty Athleisure Style</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dominic-chianese-net-worth-therichest.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dominic-chianese-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
