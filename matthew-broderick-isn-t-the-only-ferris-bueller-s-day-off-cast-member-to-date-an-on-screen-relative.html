If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”</p><p>This iconic line from 1986's Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which is one of <a href=#>John Hughes's most legendary movies</a>, is quoted so often that it has become instantly recognizable. The story of the main character deciding to skip school with his best friend and romantic interest is a total classic, which makes sense given how often teenagers think about doing that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>Hughes wasn't thrilled with the movie's cast</a>, the actors were all great, including Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, Jennifer Grey as his frustrated and cool sister Jeanie, Mia Sara as Ferris's crush Sloane Peterson, and Alan Ruck as Ferris's best pal Cameron Frye. It turns out that two relationships resulted from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, although one had a sad ending.</p><h2 id=lyman-ward-and-cindy-pickett-got-married-after-playing-ferris-bueller-39-s-parents>Lyman Ward And Cindy Pickett Got Married After Playing Ferris Bueller's Parents</h2><p>While <a href=#>Anthony Michael hall turned down the movie</a> and it would have been cool to see him as part of the cast, it's hard to think of any other actors playing these beloved characters. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cast of Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a> have all had busy careers since the movie was released in 1986, and some of the actors even fell in love.</p><p>Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett played Ferris's parents Tom and Katie and according to Entertainment Weekly, they got married in 1986. The couple didn't work out and they got divorced in 1992, although they did have two kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ferris-buellers-day-off-parents.jpg><p>Since Ferris needs to convince his parents that he's too sick to go to school, his parents are definitely important parts of the movie. One of the funniest scenes comes at the beginning when Tom and Katie Bueller agree that Ferris is sick and seem fine with him being at home. This, of course, angers Ferris's sister Jeanie, who can figure out the truth.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cindy Pickett spoke about meeting Lyman Ward</a> on the set of the movie when she appeared on the cover of New Mexico Magazine in 2017. She said, “As you probably know, Lyman Ward, who played Mr. Bueller, and I met and started dating while we were making the movie, and eventually got married and had a couple of kids of our own. When my son was around 8 years old, he turned to me after we had watched the movie a million and one times and said, 'Mom, why didn't you name me Ferris?'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pickett also called making the movie "magical" and said that on Fridays, the cast was treated to champagne and lobster. She said, “As far as being on the set, the kids mostly stayed together after work" and added, "It was an easy set, with a perfect cast, and everyone got along."</p><p>Ferris Bueller's Day Off wasn't the only time that Ward and Pickett acted together and played a couple. They also appeared in Sleepwalkers, a movie released in 1992 that is notable because Stephen King penned the screenplay. The pair played Helen and Donald Robertson, whose daughter Tanya, played by Mädchen Amick of Twin Peaks fame, begins dating Brian Krause's character Charles Brady. But in a creepy twist, Charles tries to seduce Tanya to bring her to his vampire mother Mary (Alice Krige).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Charlie Sheen Had Some Intense Preparation For 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems like the cast of the movie continues to have fond memories of their time making it. And they definitely can't ignore the cultural impact of the story. In 2016, Ferris Bueller turned 30, and fans attended Ferris Fest: A 30th Anniversary Leisure Weekend. Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett both appeared and answered questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ferris-buellers-day-off-lyman-ward-matthew-broderick-car-scene.jpg><p>According to Global News, Ward said of appearing in the famous movie, “Nothing has aged in this film and the message is still the same. It’s still carpe diem, you know, seize the day. Life moves pretty fast, better get some.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-matthew-broderick-and-jennifer-grey-39-s-relationship>Inside Matthew Broderick And Jennifer Grey's Relationship</h2><p>Of course, Ferris Bueller is the most memorable character from the '80s movie. He's a confident and fun-loving teenager who lives out every kid's dream: skipping school for the day and finding a way to get away with it (or so he thinks).</p><p>But his sister Jeanie Bueller is great as well. Her dislike of Ferris is super relatable and one of her best lines is when she goes to the police station and tells a teenage boy, "In a nutshell: I hate my brother. How's that?" It's fun to realize that Charlie Sheen played that minor character.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Charlie Sheen Did To 'Look Drunk' In ‘Ferris Bueller’s Day Off’</a></span></p><p>Jennifer Grey and Matthew Broderick were cast as a sister and brother, but they dated after meeting on the set of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The actress shared details of their relationship in her memoir Out Of The Corner, which was published in 2022. She said that no one knew that they were together while shooting Ferris Bueller's Day Off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ferris-buellers-day-off-jennifer-grey-charlie-sheen.jpg><p>Grey shared in her book, "Suddenly you're living one of those bedroom farces, padding down the carpeted hallway, barefoot in your robe, or in various stages of undress. The row of peepholes on the other guests' doors can feel like an army of eyeballs watching your every move."</p><p>It sounds like their relationship was pretty dramatic, as Grey added that once, "There appeared to be some girl he had failed to mention, who was or was not, in fact, his girlfriend. When I questioned him about this mystery woman, he assured me she was not his girlfriend but more of a close family friend who fancied him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ferris-buellers-day-off-art-institute-chicago-scene.jpg><p>According to Us Weekly, the couple was driving in Ireland in 1987 and they were involved in an accident, which ended up causing a 60-year-old mother named Margaret Doherty and her 28-year-old child, Anna, to pass away. AP News reported that Broderick went to trial for his charge of reckless driving. He was given a fine of $175.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Matthew Broderick's Most Iconic Roles (Other Than Ferris Bueller)</a></span></p><p>Grey told Entertainment Tonight, “I thought he was dead. I didn’t even know there were two other women who were tragically killed at the time. It’s just something that you just don’t come back from in the same way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the couple's romantic history includes being engaged for a short time in 1988, they didn't stay together after the car accident. According to E! News, Grey began dating Johnny Depp shortly after her breakup with Broderick in 1988, and he asked her to marry him two weeks later. She decided that the relationship wasn't right for her after nine months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidnqqinsBurtSeo6Wdoqh6pa3YZqafnl2YrrTAjKucpZmknryvv8eip6xlnZbBqbTEsGSbqp%2BZsrO1wqRko52eo7ansdFmnqudqWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./olivia-cuplo-couldn-t-afford-groceries-rent-after-nick-jonas-break-up.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./olivia-cuplo-couldn-t-afford-groceries-rent-after-nick-jonas-break-up.html>Olivia Cuplo Couldnt Afford Groceries, Rent After Nick Jonas Break-Up</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html>Mark Feuerstein Biography, Age, Net worth, Actor, Movies, T v Shows, Kids, plastic surgery, Royal pa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
