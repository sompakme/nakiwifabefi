Reports say he resigned with Camber Outdoor’s Deanne Buck amid affair rumors.</p><p>The rumors mentioned are, however, not authenticated by both sides. In addition, in the last five years or so, REI Ex-CEO has already contributed at least $1.9 million to Camber Outdoors.</p><p>Born in the year 1968. Jerry is tall with a height of 5 feet 9 inches and his weight is 73 kg approximately.

He was also promoted to the position of Director of Lululemon Athletica Inc in 1992. He also collaborated for the Victoria Secret Stores in 2013, and also acted as COO and President of Coach Inc.</p><p>In reality, Steve Hooper accepted the role and congratulated Herry for his work and creativity after Strikes resigned from the job. There is not much evidence of financial wrongdoing and the inquiry has been undertaken by REI board members along with the External Legal Team.
