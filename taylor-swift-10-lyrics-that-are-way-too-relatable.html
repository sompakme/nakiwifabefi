A lot of her songs are about <a href=#>her love life</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor Swift Trivia Most Of Her Fans Don't Even Know</a></span></p><p>Some of her albums include her self-titled album that she released in 2006, her Fearless album which she released in 2008, her Speak Now album which she released in 2010, and her Red album which she released in 2012. She also released 1989 in 2014, Reputation in 2017, Lover in 2019, and <a href=#>Folklore in 2020</a>. She just keeps getting better and better. Her lyrics&nbsp;are continually relatable.</p><h2 id=on-loving-someone-who-loves-someone-else><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>On Loving Someone Who Loves Someone Else</span></h2><p>"He says he's so in love / He's finally got it right / I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night." These gorgeous yet heartbreaking lyrics come from Taylor Swift's song "Teardrops on My Guitar" from&nbsp;her self-titled album. If this song doesn’t bring on all the feels, then what possibly does?! This song was released in 2006 and to this day, people still listen to it because they can totally relate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=on-not-finding-comfort-in-that-special-someone-anymore><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>On Not Finding Comfort In That Special Someone Anymore</span></h2><p>"I think I've seen this film before / And I didn't like the ending / You're not my homeland anymore / So what am I defending now?" These lyrics come from Taylor Swift's song “Exile” on her Folklore album. This particular album was released by Taylor Swift in 2020 so it is her most recent music drop. For over a decade now she has been killing the game with her lyrics and she did it again with this particular song.</p><h2 id=on-overcoming-heartbreak><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>On Overcoming Heartbreak</span></h2><p>"But I took your matches before fire could catch me / So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town." These searing, harsh, and deep-cutting lyrics were part of her song "Dear John" from her album Speak Now. Everyone knows by now that this song was meant for <a href=#>John Mayer</a>’s ears. She directly addressed him by using his name in the title of the song. He messed with her heart when she was only 19 years old which was very messed up of him. She called him out in front of the public with this masterfully written song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=on-not-wanting-to-be-forgotten><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>On&nbsp;Not Wanting To Be Forgotten</span></h2><p>"Say you'll remember me / Standin' in a nice dress / Starin' at the sunset, babe / Red lips and rosy cheeks / Say you'll see me again / Even if it's just in your wildest dreams." These beautiful and wildly romantic lyrics comes from her song "Wildest Dreams" from&nbsp;her album 1989. This is the type of song that people can relate to when they know that their relationship is going to be coming to an end. Things may not be working out with the person they are with what they still don’t want that person to forget about them.</p><h2 id=on-pretending-not-to-care><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>On Pretending Not To Care</span></h2><p>"This is looking like a contest / Of who can act like they care less / But I liked it better when you were on my side / The battle's in your hands now / But I would lay my armor down / If you'd say you'd rather love than fight." These difficult and emotional relationship-centered lyrics come from the song "The Story of Us" from her Sparks Fly album. Why is it that people try to pretend like they don’t care? There’s no problems with showing emotions but in this generation, it’s the cooler thing to do to act like you don’t have any feelings at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=on-hoping-the-person-you-like-isn-t-already-taken><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>On Hoping The Person You Like Isn't Already Taken</span></h2><p>"I'll spend forever wondering if you knew / I was enchanted to meet you / Please don't be in love with someone else / Please don't have somebody waiting on you."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Everything We Know About Taylor Swift's $400 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Taylor Swift's romantic song "Enchanted" from her Sparks Fly album is where you will find these lyrics. Anyone who has had a crush on someone else who is in a relationship with another person can easily relate to these lyrics.</p><h2 id=on-waiting-around-amp-wanting-to-be-with-the-person-you-love><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>On Waiting Around & Wanting To Be With The Person You Love</span></h2><p>"If you could see that I'm the one who understands you / Been here all along, so why can't you see / You belong with me / You belong with me." This award-winning song is called "You belong With Me" from her Fearless album. Who remembers the fact that this is the song she won a VMA award for over <a href=#>Beyonce</a> leading to the infamous <a href=#>Kanye West</a> microphone snatching scene?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=on-the-realities-of-relationships><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>On The Realities Of Relationships</span></h2><p>"I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale / I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet / Lead her up the stairwell / This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town / I was a dreamer before you went and let me down / Now it's too late for you /And your white horse, to come around."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Why Taylor Swift Loves Paul McCartney</a></span></p><p>These hard-hitting reality check lyrics come from Taylor Swift's song "White Horse" from her Fearless album.</p><h2 id=on-learning-how-to-live-without-that-person><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>On Learning How To Live Without That Person</span></h2><p>"And I can't breathe, without you / But I have to, breathe / Without you, but I have to." This song is all about trying to learn how to breathe again without the person you're in love with. How depressing... The song is called "Breathe" from Taylor Swift's Fearless album and the track features Colbie Caillat. She has also collaborated with <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=on-wanting-to-be-close-to-the-one-you-love-forever><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>On Wanting To Be Close To The One You Love Forever</span></h2><p>"Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever?" These lyrics come from her album Lover on the song "Lover." This song is super romantic and makes anyone who is already in a relationship feel very grateful for the person that they love. It also makes single people hopeful for a future where they can spend their time growing extremely close to the person that they love.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor Swift Showers Bon Iver's Music With Praise</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lnaTAtXnRnqOarJGXuaZ5y7KpopujZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-10-lyrics-that-are-way-too-relatable.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-10-lyrics-that-are-way-too-relatable.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-10-lyrics-that-are-way-too-relatable.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-10-lyrics-that-are-way-too-relatable.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-10-lyrics-that-are-way-too-relatable.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-10-lyrics-that-are-way-too-relatable.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zooey-deschanel-a-lot-of-actresses-are-unhealthy-skinny.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zooey-deschanel-a-lot-of-actresses-are-unhealthy-skinny.html>Zooey Deschanel: A Lot of Actresses Are Unhealthy-Skinny</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pic-high-school-musical-s-ashley-tisdale-poses-nude.html>PIC: High School Musical's Ashley Tisdale Poses Nude</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pic-high-school-musical-s-ashley-tisdale-poses-nude.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
