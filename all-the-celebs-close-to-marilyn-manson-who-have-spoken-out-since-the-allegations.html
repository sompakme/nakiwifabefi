Branded a shock rocker when he first burst onto the alt music scene in the '90s, Manson was embroiled in various controversies at the height of his career. From claims that his music <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired the Columbine School massacre</a> to tales of his on stage shock tactics, he has undoubtedly been a divisive figure. But there was always an assumption among fans that these tactics were part of his oeuvre, that there was no real malice to his intentions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything That's Happened Since Allegations Against Marilyn Manson Came To Light</a></span></p><p>That all changed, however, when some truly damning allegations surfaced this year, ones which appeared analogous to&nbsp;Manson's dark and often violent lyrics.&nbsp;His ex, <strong>Evan Rachel Wood</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused him of appalling abuse</a> and many other&nbsp;women followed suit. These are all the celebs close to Manson who have spoken out since the allegations.</p><h2 id=rose-mcgowan><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Rose McGowan</span></h2><p>Actress turned activist Rose McGowan played a vital role in the MeToo movement and she isn't one to avoid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking out about sexual misconduct.</a>&nbsp;Famously, she&nbsp;was engaged to&nbsp;Marilyn Manson from the late '90s until the early 2000s. Now, she has spoken out about her ex and expressed her support for Evan Rachel Wood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Instagram, she said&nbsp;that she is "proud" of the women who have come forward, adding, "And to all those who have covered for monsters, shame on you."</p><h2 id=trent-reznor><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Trent Reznor</span></h2><p>Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor was once a close friend and collaborator of Manson, having produced his debut album Portrait of an American Family.&nbsp;But their friendship dissolved decades ago and Reznor has kept his distance ever since. In&nbsp;his 1998 autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Manson claimed that he and Reznor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">assaulted a woman in the '90s</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reznor released a statement denouncing Manson: "I have been vocal over the years about my dislike of Manson as a person and cut ties with his nearly 25 years ago. As I said at the time, the passage from Manson's memoir is a complete fabrication. I was infuriated and offended back when it came out and remain so today."</p><h2 id=dita-von-teese><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dita Von Teese</span></h2><p>Burlesque performer Dita Von Teese was married to Manson from 2005 to 2007, breaking up due to his infidelity. Her response to the Manson accusers' claims <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">left fans somewhat confused</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Dita Von Teese's Boyfriend Adam Rajcevich, And What Does He Do?</a></span></p><p>"Abuse of any kind&nbsp;has no place in any relationship. I urge those of who have incurred abuse to take steps to heal and the strength to fully realize yourself," she wrote on Instagram. Many saw the statement at a subtle attack on survivors, as Von Teese seemed to be intimating that the abuse would not have happened if the women were "fully realized".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wes-borland><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Wes Borland</span></h2><p>Wes Borland is best known as the lead guitarist of Limp Bizkit, but he also joined Marilyn Manson's band in 2008. He has not minced his words when it comes to speaking out against his former bandmate.</p><p>On Twitch, he said, "He's not a great guy and every single thing that people have said about him is ****ing true... They are speaking the truth."</p><h2 id=sharon-osbourne><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sharon Osbourne</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many years, Manson&nbsp;has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close to the Osbourne family</a>. In particular he&nbsp;is friends with Sharon Osbourne, with whom he has also had a working relationship spanning over 25 years. In light of the abuse allegations, Osbourne&nbsp;has been hesitant to denounce the rocker.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Marilyn Manson's Troubled Relationship With His Mom</a></span></p><p>"But as far as people who've been going on all my socials, calling me names and things and putting up pictures of Marilyn and I, you know, there's something called a working relationship, and that's what I've had with Marilyn for many years," she told The Talk. "I know nothing about his sexual preferences or the way he treats women. I know how he treats an older woman, which is me, and he's always been respectful."</p><h2 id=amber-heard><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Amber Heard</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been common knowledge for quite some time that Marilyn Manson shares an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unlikely bromance with Johnny Depp</a>. Accordingly,&nbsp;the rockstar&nbsp;would have encountered Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard on numerous occasions.</p><p>Following Evan Rachel Wood's claims, Heard blasted people for ignoring Manson's alleged abuse for years. She Tweeted, "...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan & I aren't the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?"</p><h2 id=brian-head-welch><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Brian "Head" Welch</span></h2><p>Guitarist for nu-metal band Korn, Brian "Head" Welch said that he sympathised greatly with Evan Rachel Wood. "She had real pain when she talked about it," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told NME</a>. "That is some real trauma that she had."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But he also said that he hoped Manson would get help: "If Manson did some of this stuff, he just needs to get help like everybody else and I wish the best for him and Evan Rachel Wood and I hope that the world grows from this and becomes a better place."</p><h2 id=phoebe-bridgers><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Phoebe Bridgers</span></h2><p>Singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers recalled a horrifying&nbsp;encounter with Manson and suggested that those close to the&nbsp;musician&nbsp;knew of his alleged violent behavior.</p><p>"I went to Marilyn Manson's house when I was a teenager with some friends," she Tweeted. "I was a big fan. He referred to a room in his house as the "r*pe room", I thought it was just his horrible frat boy sense of humor. I stopped being a fan."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alice-cooper><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Alice Cooper</span></h2><p>A precursor to Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper was arguably the original shock rocker and his influence on Manson is inarguable. He made some rather controversial statements regarding the abuse claims, suggesting that people shouldn't automatically believe accusers.</p><p>"It's funny about Marilyn, in that I know Marilyn - when we toured together we got along very well. I never noticed that streak in him, if it's there," he told NME. "I always believe in the word, allegations are still allegations." It should be noted that Manson, like most alleged abusers, would have been unlikely to exhibit his sexually violent streak in front of other men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=esm-bianco><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Esmé Bianco</span></h2><p>Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco has spoken out about the deep scars and PTSD that Manson allegedly caused her. She has claimed that Manson flew her to LA to shoot a music video in 2009 and proceeded to subject her to degradation and torture. Manson denies the claims.</p><p>Bianco <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has&nbsp;explained</a> that Manson went from being a "massive role model who really helped me through some incredibly dark and difficult times as a teenager" to a "monster who almost destroyed me and almost destroyed so many women."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Marilyn Manson Rarely Goes Out In Public Without Makeup</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpaRdqbWmecKeo56ao2KwrbvSnmStp12irrO1y7KlZqWRo8Cwuoywn6hlmJbDpnnSqaaknZ5ivLbAjKygp5uVYsGpsYyao6Wdl5bBqrvNrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html>BTS May Just Be The Most Versatile Boy Band Ever, Here's Why</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html>10 Spooky Celebrity Ghost Sightings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
