In 2009, after CNN ran a special on Jackson’s life entitled Inside Neverland, fans swore a shadowy image in one of the mansion’s long hallways was the King of Pop’s ghost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, <a title="Pete Doherty Net Worth" href=#>Pete Doherty</a>, the former Libertines co-frontman better known for his drug use and on-and-off romance with supermodel <a title="Kate Moss Net Worth" href=#>Kate Moss</a>, told The Sun that the ghost of <a title="Amy Winehouse Net Worth" href=#>Amy Winehouse</a> was haunting his flat.</p><p>Some celebrities remain famous in the afterlife while others recede into oblivion. Some A-listers go gently into that good night while others, long after they’ve shed their mortal coil, are still primping for close-ups. An entire industry is built around celebrity ghosts and paranormal, paparazzi ghost hunters. Call it a ghostly encore. Call it 10 actors in search of a director. Whatever you want to call it, these famous celebrities lingered long after the lights went out.</p><h2 id=10-anna-nicole-smith><strong>10. Anna Nicole Smith</strong></h2><p>In February 2007, former Playboy Playmate <a title="Anna Nicole Smith Net Worth" href=#>Anna Nicole Smith</a> died in room 607 at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. According to a story in In Touch Weekly, a guest named Stephanie Pont saw Anna Nicole’s spirit wandering the hotel in 2008. Pont was attending a party at the hotel’s Passion Club on New Years Eve, so whether she saw Anna Nicole’s ghost or simply imbibed in too much champagne is up for debate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anna Nicole Smith famously revealed to FMH magazine that she had supernatural sexual encounters. The busty blonde said, “A ghost would crawl up my leg and have sex with me at an apartment a long time ago in Texas. I used to think it was my boyfriend, then one day I woke up and it wasn’t.”</p><p>If Anna Nicole Smith can have supernatural sex, then it seems only fitting that her spirit is wandering around the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in search of a good time.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-bugsy-siegel>&nbsp;<strong>9. Bugsy Siegel</strong></h2><p>In 1947, an unknown assailant fired nine shots through a window of a Beverly Hills home, killing one of the most infamous and feared gangsters, Bugsy Siegel. Siegel’s spirit has since been seen in the house, which at the time belonged to his girlfriend, Virginia Hill. Siegel’s ghost has also been spotted at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino, the famous joint on the Las Vegas Strip that he helped build and develop, and the place where his illegal activity probably led to him getting whacked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-lucille-ball><strong>8. Lucille Ball</strong></h2><p>The star of I Love Lucy died in 1989 at the age of 77 from an acute aorta aneurysm. At the time of her death, Lucille Ball was living in her home at 1000 North Roxbury Drive. The “First Lady of Television” is said to haunt her beloved home. Throughout the years, those who’ve lived at North Roxbury Drive have reported unexplained voices in the attic and broken windows. However, Lucy’s ghost isn’t just causing trouble at her Beverly Hills home. Workers claim she also haunts the building that used to be DesiLu Studios on the Paramount lot.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-george-reeves><strong>7. George Reeves</strong></h2><p>Did George Reeves commit suicide at age 45 because of his failing film career, or was he the victim of foul play? Reeves is best known for his portrayal of Superman in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. Supposedly, George Reeves’ ghost haunts his former home, and strange noises can be heard coming from the upstairs bedroom where he committed “suicide.” Nevertheless, little credence was given to this tale of celebrity haunting until a television crew doing a documentary on Reeves saw his ghost dressed in Superman attire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-jean-harlow><strong>&nbsp;6. Jean Harlow</strong></h2><p>Jean Harlow died at age 26 from kidney disease. It's believed the scarlet fever she had as a child contributed to her untimely death. However, alcoholism, sunstroke, a botched abortion, and poisoning due to platinum hair dye are just a few of the sensationalistic stories surrounding her death.</p><p>Jean Harlow was married to Hollywood producer, Paul Bern. Bern shot himself in the bathroom two months after his marriage to the sex symbol. Both Harlow and Bern are said to haunt their old Hollywood home.</p><p>But here’s the turn of the screw. Jay Sebring, an American hairstylist for celebrities, bought the Harlow home because of its dark history. When actress Sharon Tate visited Sebring, she claimed to have seen Paul Bern’s ghost. Four years later, Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring were killed by the Manson family.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-john-lennon><strong>5. John Lennon</strong></h2><p>Julian Lennon says he was contacted by his father’s ghost. <a title="Paul McCartney Net Worth" href=#>Paul McCartney</a> claims that when he, <a title="George Harrison Net Worth" href=#>George Harrison</a>, and Ringo Star sang Lennon’s song “Free as a Bird,” John’s ghost was in the studio with them. And former Oasis front man Liam Gallagher claims his idol visited him in Manchester, England.</p><p>Everyone else with a paranormal <a title="John Lennon Net Worth" href=#>John Lennon</a> story, however, claims to have seen the Beatle at the Dakota, Manhattan’s prestigious apartment complex and Lennon’s home from 1973 to 1980. John Lennon was shot and killed by Mark Chapman out front of the Dakota in 1980.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-orson-welles><strong>4. Orson Welles</strong></h2><p>Orson Welles, the boy wonder of radio and stage, changed the face of cinema with his 1941 directorial debut, Citizen Kane. Welles only made 13 full-length films, and none were as well received as the story of Charles Foster Kane. The film’s nonlinear narrative, deep focus shots, and chiaroscuro lighting earned Orson Welles the title of “the ultimate auteur.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Orson Welles wasn’t butting heads with industry honchos over creative freedom, he spent his time at Ma Maison restaurant. Perhaps this accounts for the weight gain he experienced later in his career. Ma Maison has since been turned into the Sweet Lady Jane Bakery, but that hasn’t stopped Orson’s ghost from taking a seat at his favorite corner table. Witnesses say Welles’ ghost only appears for a few seconds and is dressed in a black suit and a wide-brimmed hat.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-adolf-hitler><strong>3. Adolf Hitler</strong></h2><p>Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin on April 30, 1945. However, the world’s most despised dictator is said to haunt his former Bavarian mountain retreat. According to Gerhardt Strauss, a German historian, “If you look in the shadows of the linden trees and the shattered remains of his mountain home, you can see his spirit wandering aimlessly throughout the ruins.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The presence of Hitler’s ghost seems more like fiction than fact, or perhaps Gerhardt Strauss is speaking metaphorically. Still, it hasn’t stopped curious tourists and ghost hunters from visiting Hitler's Bavarian home. Witnesses say Hitler’s spirit can often be found sitting in an armchair, dejected and defeated, with his head cradled in his hands. Others claim to have seen him striding through the ruins, yelling commands at his men, fighting a war long lost to Allied Forces</p><p></p><h2 id=2-elvis-presley><strong>2. Elvis Presley</strong></h2><p><a title="Elvis Presley Net Worth" href=#>Elvis</a> has left the building… Well, apparently not. The King of rock n’ roll may have died at the "tender" age of 42, but his ghost continues to haunt Graceland. In fact, Elvis believed in the paranormal and used to say that his mother’s ghost would often visit and talk to him. Elvis and his mother, Gladys, are both buried at Graceland, so it’s possible they’re haunting the 13.8-acre Memphis estate together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Graceland isn’t the only site that Elvis is believed to haunt. Presley had a residency at the Vegas Hilton in the ‘70s, and his ghost has been spotted at the hotel. Stagehands claim to have seen his ghost riding the backstage elevator dressed in the famous white, sequined jumpsuit. Presley's spirit has also been spotted at the old RCA recording studio, where he recorded his first number one hit, Heartbreak Hotel.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-marilyn-monroe><strong>1. Marilyn Monroe</strong></h2><p>Did <a title="Marilyn Monroe Net Worth" href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a> commit suicide, or was her death an accident? Did government spooks kill Monroe because of her affair with JFK? Did the mafia kill Monroe in their vengeance against the Kennedy brothers, or did RFK commit the crime himself? It’s no surprise that the unusual circumstances and conspiracies surrounding Marilyn’s death have led to stories of a restless spirit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marilyn Monroe has been dead for more than 50 years, but her ghost is said to haunt the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Marilyn stayed in a poolside suite at the hotel during the height of her popularity. Several guests have seen her ghostly image in the room’s full-length mirror. Even after hotel management moved the mirror into the lobby, visitors claimed to see the blonde beauty's reflection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXZuurrvUrGScnZyar7O107JkoKCfqMG0edKtoKWkXaiyprqMraadmalk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-spooky-celebrity-ghost-sightings.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./all-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./all-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html>All The Celebs Close To Marilyn Manson Who Have Spoken Out Since The Allegations</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-celebrities-who-have-huge-watch-collections.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Huge Watch Collections</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-celebrities-who-have-huge-watch-collections.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
