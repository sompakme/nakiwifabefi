The truth is the Peter Ostrum, who played Charlie, chose a seemingly unconventional life journey for a child actor.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what happened to Peter Ostrum.</p><h2 id=willy-wonka-made-him-a-household-name>‘Willy Wonka’ Made Him A Household Name</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2BFE7714-7B3D-4A8A-963B-3D2D1D5AAB6A.jpeg><p>Most folks entering the entertainment industry will spend years looking for their chance at a big break. For Peter Ostrum, his big break came in his very first movie when he was cast as Charlie in&nbsp;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This means that he started off his career with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">genuine cinematic classic</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ostrum was noticed at the Cleveland Playhouse when he was just a kid, and this came at a time when a nationwide search for talent was going on for the film. He wound up being the perfect choice to play Charlie in the movie, and the young Ostrum headed off to Munich to take part in what became one of the greatest movies of all time.</p><p>Though it was a modest financial success upon its release, generating $4 million at the box office, the movie has been able to stand the test of time and has become a must-watch for people of all ages. Not only was it a staple of television for decades, but the movie also became a right of passage while growing up. Simply put, it’s almost impossible to find someone who has not seen this movie.</p><p>Despite the success that he found with&nbsp;Willy Wonka,&nbsp;Ostrum wound up taking a massive detour in life and doing something that no one saw coming.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Was Brad Pitt To Playing Willy Wonka?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-attended-cornell-to-become-a-veterinarian>He Attended Cornell To Become A Veterinarian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/B8F48245-09F0-4897-8A10-072B05FBEC45.jpeg><p>At just 12 years old, Peter Ostrum became a Hollywood success, and he was even offered a three-picture deal with the studio. Most actors would have jumped all over this opportunity, but instead, Ostrum headed back home in favor of living out a normal life.</p><p>It was his return back home that got him interested in working with horses, and eventually, Ostrum would pursue a career as a veterinarian. He did briefly try his hand at acting again, but after being unable to land any roles, he shifted his life’s focus to being a veterinarian and even wound up attending Cornell. This put an end to his acting days, and it kickstarted a new era for the former performer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since graduating, Peter Ostrum has devoted his life to working with animals, and this was something that caught people by surprise when they learned of what he chose to do with his life. Keep in mind that this happened during a time when information&nbsp;wasn’t nearly as accessible as it is now.</p><p>Despite putting Hollywood behind him and moving on with being a vet, Ostrum has still taken opportunities to talk about the film and his experience making movie history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Fun Facts About The Making Of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-made-the-occasional-appearance>He’s Made The Occasional Appearance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/81D10936-9993-4321-A943-30268D02561D.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A movie like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one that people come back and revisit time and time again, and because of this, there will always be an interest in what the members of the cast are currently up to. Peter Ostrum has been open about his time making the movie and has made some unique appearances through the years.</p><p>Not only has the actor appeared at different conventions in the past, but he has also appeared on shows like Oprah, Top Chef, and several shows focusing on former actors and where they are now. This is all due to the lasting legacy of the movie and his decision to eventually leave it all behind for a different life.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, one interesting thing that Ostrum has done through the years is talk with the kids at Lowville Academy once a year about his time making the movie and about his life as a veterinarian. While he is not one for interviews, this is still a cool way that he is connecting with audiences of the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Carrey Almost Got The Role Of Willy Wonka In 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory'</a></span></p><p>Willy Wonka is one of the most timeless films ever made, and while it changed Peter Ostrum’s life forever, there was something much bigger out there for him.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Top 10 Disney Live-Action Remakes, Ranked According To IMDb</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkmsOmvoyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoJViuKqwjLCfqGWgoa66scNmmqGZoqG2pnnIp2SwoZyhxm7Dzqeimmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhatever-happened-to-the-kid-who-played-charlie-in-willy-wonka.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhatever-happened-to-the-kid-who-played-charlie-in-willy-wonka.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-the-kid-who-played-charlie-in-willy-wonka.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhatever-happened-to-the-kid-who-played-charlie-in-willy-wonka.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-the-kid-who-played-charlie-in-willy-wonka.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-the-kid-who-played-charlie-in-willy-wonka.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-merrie-cherry-details-to-know-about-the-cast-of-dragula-season-4.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-merrie-cherry-details-to-know-about-the-cast-of-dragula-season-4.html>Who Is Merrie Cherry?
