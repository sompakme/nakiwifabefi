<time>11 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Steve Salas, a founding member of the pioneering Eastside rock band Tierra and an early-day Chicano rights activist, has died after battling myeloma for two years and recently contracted COVID-19.</p><p>Salas died on Thursday.&nbsp;He was 69.<br>His brother Rudy, Tierra’s lead singer and co-founder died in 2020, also after contracting COVID-19.</p><p>“Steve and Rudy created the soundtrack for many people’s lives, and we are so grateful to everyone who loved their music,” the band and family members said in a statement.</p><p>The death of the Salas brothers leaves saxophonist Rudy “Bub” Villa, 72, as the lone surviving member of the original group, which formed in 1972.</p><p>“Steve was this guy who liked to have fun, not take things too seriously and fool around, which bugged Rudy,” Villa said. “As a musician, he was multitalented and could learn any instrument within a few hours and just had a tone and presence as a singer that was incredible.”</p><p>The trio came together in 1972 along with David Torres (keyboard) and Albert Bustillos (drums) to form Tierra. According to Villa, Bustillos “played a few gigs” before leaving and being eventually replaced by drummer Kenny Roman midway through 1972.</p><p>Steve Salas, a singer, bass player, and percussionist, performed with his brother in some fashion for more than a decade, most notably as the Salas Brothers. The duo worked on neighborhood functions, such as weddings and graduations.</p><p>Steve and Rudy Salas grew up in Lincoln Heights with their mother, Margaret Brambila, and father, Rudy Sr. Their uncle, Art Brambila, lived across the street.</p><p>He stayed less than two years before returning to Lincoln Heights and joined his brother as a member of the Chicano R&B group El Chicano.</p><p>In 1972, El Chicano released “Celebration,” in which Steve Salas and Freddie Sanchez were the featured vocalists in a cover of Van Morrison’s famed “Brown Eyed Girl.” Their version of the song climbed to No. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that year.</p><p>Joanna Salas, Rudy’s wife, said her husband and his brother loved each other, no matter their differences.</p><p>“Steve was and will always be remembered as a very talented, complicated, and rambunctious type of individual,” Joanna Salas said. “He didn’t go by the rules and lived his life the way he wanted.”</p><p>Steve Salas was married briefly in the mid-1970s and had no children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKukmsOmedKao5qrXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteve-salas-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsteve-salas-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsteve-salas-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsteve-salas-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteve-salas-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-salas-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-mid-90s-belonged-to-coolio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-mid-90s-belonged-to-coolio.html>The Mid-90s Belonged to Coolio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pene-delmage-albert-finney-s-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Pene Delmage (Albert Finneys Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pene-delmage-albert-finney-s-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
