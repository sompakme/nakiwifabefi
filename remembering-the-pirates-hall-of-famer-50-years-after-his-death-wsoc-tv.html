He was named to <a href=#>15 All-Star teams</a>, was the NL’s MVP in 1966 and won <a href=#>12 straight Gold Gloves</a> beginning in 1961. He finished with <a href=#>3,000 hits</a>, the 11th player in MLB history to achieve that feat.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Passionate and outspoken, Clemente’s humanitarian efforts showed a softer side. In a cruel twist of fate, Clemente’s charity led to his death at age 38.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">On Dec. 31, 1972, Clemente boarded a plane in his native Puerto Rico. The four-engine DC-7 aircraft, chartered by the Pirates’ star right fielder, reportedly had a history of mechanical problems. The plane was overloaded by 4,200 pounds with supplies for earthquake relief to residents in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff. Clemente’s body was never found. Four other people were killed.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente had decided to follow the supplies to Managua after learning that some of the three previous shipments had been diverted by corrupt government officials in Nicaragua since the massive earthquake rocked Managua on Dec. 23, 1972.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I think the thing that … that … well, I guess killed him, was his desire to do things for people,” Pirates general manager Joe Brown told UPI sports editor Milton Richman in January 1973. “What he was trying to do for the people in Nicaragua was one of the few public things he did.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“He generally did things, kind things, that few people knew about.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente was inducted into the <a href=#>National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1973 in a special election that waived the mandatory five-year waiting period. He joined Lou Gehrig as the only members of Cooperstown to receive that exemption. Clemente also was posthumously awarded a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1973 for his humanitarian efforts, according to <a href=#>Bleacher Report.</a></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Here are some Clemente memories.</p><h2 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 duFLhq"><b>Personal life</b></h2><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Roberto Clemente Walker was born on August 18, 1934, to Melchor Clemente and Luisa Walker de Clemente in Carolina, Puerto Rico, according to the <a href=#>Society for American Baseball Research</a>. He was the youngest of his mother’s seven children. Three of his older siblings were from a previous marriage.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente married Vera Zabala (better known as Doña Vera) in Carolina on Nov. 14, 1964. They had three sons – Roberto Clemente Jr., Luis Roberto Clemente and Roberto Enrique Clemente.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/clSeGlMKES9YXf4O63PPZvXWvas=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/cmg/TVIPUR7GJ5GWFKFU5JFRO6K6IA.jpg"><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Vera Clemente died in November 2019.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">As a child, Clemente “had his own way of doing things,” David Maraniss wrote in his 2006 biography, “<a href=#>Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball’s Last Hero</a>.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“He was pensive, intelligent, and could not be rushed. He wanted to know how and why.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">When asked to do something, Clemente would tell his family “<i>momentito</i>,” (just a moment) and said it so often that his older cousin, Flora, who took care of him, began calling him “Momen.” It was a nickname that stuck with Clemente among family, friends and the baseball fields of his youth, Maraniss wrote.</p><h2 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 duFLhq"><b>Getting to the pros</b></h2><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">When he was 14, Clemente joined a softball team organized by Roberto Marin, according to <a href=#>SABR</a>. Marin, impressed by the youngster’s arm, began using him at shortstop but then moved him to the outfield.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Three years later, Clemente was playing for the Santurce Crabbers of the Puerto Rican Baseball League. The Brooklyn Dodgers signed him in 1952, and by 1954 he was playing for the Triple-A Montreal Royals.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The Pirates claimed Clemente after the 1954 season in the Rule 5 draft, paying $4,000. He joined Pittsburgh’s parent club for good in 1955 and made his debut on April 17 at Forbes Field – against the Dodgers in the first game of a doubleheader.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente started in right field and went 1-for-4, scoring a run, according to <a href=#>Retrosheet.org</a>. Wearing No. 13 – center fielder Earl Smith wore No. 21 early in 1955 – Clemente got an infield hit in the first inning when Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese got his glove on the ball but could not field it cleanly. He scored the first of his 1,416 runs moments later when Frank Thomas tripled.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente added two hits, including a double, and scored a run in the nightcap. The Pirates, however, lost both games.</p><p></p><h2 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 duFLhq"><b>Don’t run on him</b></h2><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">According to <a href=#>Baseball-Reference.com</a>, Clemente had <a href=#>266 assists</a> and participated in <a href=#>42 double plays</a> during the regular season across 18 seasons in the majors.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">According to the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, Clemente “was blessed with perhaps the strongest, most accurate arm of any right fielder who played the game.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente, who threw the javelin while in high school at Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina, said he inherited his strong arm from his mother.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“My mother has the same kind of an arm, even today at 74,” Clemente said during a 1964 interview. “She could throw a ball from second base to home plate with something on it. I got my arm from my mother.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Here’s a sampling of the arm that gave runners pause.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">On July 21, 1970, at the Astrodome, Clemente’s Pirates were facing Houston. Jesus Alou walked to open the home half of the first inning and Joe Morgan then sent a stinging line drive single to right field. Alou went to third on the play, and Morgan took a wide turn at first.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Bad move. Clemente threw behind Morgan to first baseman Al Oliver, who tagged the surprised future Hall of Famer out after he got caught in a rundown.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Even fellow Hall of Famers rarely challenged Clemente.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Maraniss recounts a memory shared by San Francisco Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry. Willie Mays was on second base in a tie game during the late innings. Clemente was in right field.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">A teammate singled to right field, but “Mays rounds third and screeches to a halt,” Perry said. “When you have the world’s best base runner put on the brakes on a hit to right, you know it’s because the world’s best arm is in right. And it was a close game. We needed that run.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6ajr3LG8VFOXwcSOSjvbHFIccPk=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/cmg/B5RRNKSDYRHA3BVWSGVDCP7UDQ.jpg"><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">According to <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a>, the right-field wall at Pittsburgh’s PNC Park is 21 feet high, which honors Clemente’s uniform number and his fielding position. While he played his home games at Forbes Field and Three Rivers Stadium, right field would always be Clemente’s domain. Woe to a runner who tried to test his arm.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Clemente could field the ball in New York and throw out a guy in Pennsylvania,” legendary Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully once said.</p><h2 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 duFLhq"><b>Battles with the media</b></h2><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente never had a smooth relationship with reporters.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">According to the <a href=#>Hall of Fame</a>, some of that tension began in 1960, when he finished eighth in the NL’s MVP voting. Clemente had no issue with teammate Dick Groat winning the award, but he considered the eighth-place finish an insult, believing he should have finished higher in the balloting.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente told reporters that his finish was due to “political reasons,” code words for his belief that racism against Latino players had a role in his low finish.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“He was convinced that it was due to that,” Luis Mayoral, a longtime writer, broadcaster and executive who also was Clemente’s friend. “To the day of his death, he was convinced of that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/ixGfL3TmRT0eG0G58JPZOi_y8qk=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/cmg/NJWYJSUHBBBB3MDYM5BNYSORBE.jpg"><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Sportswriters sent mixed signals in their coverage of Clemente.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Writers would ignore Clemente’s heritage and ethnicity, referring to him as “Bob” or “Bobby” instead of his given name. Even Clemente’s baseball cards listed him as “Bob Clemente,” a practice that finally ended with the <a href=#>1970 Topps set</a>. Topps referred to him as “Roberto” for his 1955 rookie card and his 1956 card, but from 1957 until 1959 the cards listed him as “<a href=#>Bob</a>.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente did not like the Americanization of his name, believing it disrespected his Puerto Rican and Latino roots. He would correct sportswriters during interviews.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Writers reluctant to use Clemente’s given name nevertheless quoted him and other Latino players phonetically. “This” was written as “deez,” or “give” was “geev.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“They laugh at me, but I heet the ball,” New York Daily News columnist Dick Young quoted Clemente as saying during the 1971 World Series.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente believed that by highlighting his accent, writers were attempting to make him – and other Latino players – look foolish.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“It makes him sound like he’s dumb,” former Pirates pitcher-turned-broadcaster Nellie King once said. “And you know, he was a very intelligent man.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I don’t know why the media did that. It sure made him seem less than intelligent. I mean, how would you like to go to Puerto Rico (speak Spanish), and have guys quote you the way you sound?”</p><h2 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 duFLhq"><b>Standing up</b></h2><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clemente believed in helping those in need, and people who were victimized by discrimination.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Dad knew he had a mission when he started playing,” Luis Clemente told the <a href=#>Times</a>. “He always said that he was going to represent those that didn’t have a voice. … He knew he was representing the underdog in life and I think that resonated with many people.
