According to Arcola, the assault occurred at NBA YoungBoy’s home in Utah, where he’<a href=#>s currently on house arrest</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Watch who you have kids by,” she began, sharing a photo of herself with blood on her face from a cut above her eye, presumably sustained during the alleged attack. “My son dad let his whoreS yes whores with an S cause it was 2 of them weak a** ho*s. He gave them an order to get me lol you know bi**hes who never came from sh*t gone do it. My son was in my hands.

So I told him keep him 2 more weeks. He was pissed lmao I just feel like if you ain’t gone help me financially you gone help physically.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He’s so unreasonable so happy this is all over with now,” she added. “I asked his wife [Jazlyn Mychelle] if she can ask him to get just kaell flight and he said no. Keep in mind the flights was 1300 for both of ours round trip and all i asked was for him to pay for kaells. ni**a still couldnt do that. So i was just like f**k it. im tired! anytime he ask for his son i drop him off and pay for the tickets. bi**h you dont help with sh*`t why i gotta keep paying for the flights?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1023694948.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Arcola said that after requesting to retrieve their son from YoungBoy’s home, he told her to wait two additional weeks before coming to pick him up, only to later tell her that she could visit the child on weekends.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“LMFAO them drugs got his mind gone,” she wrote, referencing the rapper’s alleged substance abuse. The mother then says she took it upon herself to come to YoungBoy’s home to pick up their son, only to be ignored, prompting her to search the home for the child herself. “I finally found him and his whores was trying to take my son out of my hands smh I cannot make this up.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The alleged victim says that, despite the women’s best efforts to take her son away from her during the altercation, she refused to let go and ultimately left the premises with the child, who was apparently uninjured during the skirmish. Arcola also says that she doesn’t plan to press charges against the rapper or the women involved in the alleged skirmish, which she says resulted in her getting five stitches to close a laceration above her eye.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I would be wrong if I pressed charges on yall for doing me like this with my baby in my hand.
