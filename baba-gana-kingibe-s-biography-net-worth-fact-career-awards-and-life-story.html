In 1993 Nigerian presidential election, he was the vice presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kingibe was born to the family of Mustafa Shuwa and Ya Kingi Mallam. A Kanuri from Borno, he grew up in Maiduguri and attended primary schools there.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=education></span>Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 1958, he was admitted into the Borno Provincial Secondary School. In 1960, he left for the United Kingdom on a government scholarship to complete his O’Level and A-level at Bishop’s Stortford College.</p><p>In 1968, he received his bachelor’s degree in international relations from the University of Sussex (alongside Thabo Mbeki), before proceeding to the BBC Television Training School in London. Kingibe later attended the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-career></span>Early career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 1969, he returned to Nigeria and was employed by the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. At the university, he became acquainted with the Kaduna Mafia, a group of young western-educated intellectuals, civil servants and military officers from Northern Nigeria. Kingibe left the university towards the end of the Nigerian Civil War, and became head of the current affairs department at the Broadcasting Corporation of Northern Nigeria (BCNN).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=diplomatic-service></span>Diplomatic service<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1972, he joined the Nigerian Foreign Service where his first posting was the Nigerian High Commission in London as a senior political counsellor and later became the head of the political desk.</p><p>In 1981, at the age of 36, he was appointed the Nigerian Ambassador to Greece and Cyprus. Kingibe was later appointed the Nigerian Ambassador to Pakistan by General Ibrahim Babangida.</p><p>Kingibe also served from October 2002 to September 2006 as the Special Envoy of the African Union to Sudan and subsequently Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission and head of the African Union Mission in Sudan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=political-career></span>Political career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following the 1976 Nigerian coup d’état attempt, Kingibe was seconded to the Supreme Military Headquarters (SMHQ) as the Principal Political Secretary, from 1976 to 1979, where he was involved in the planning of the military’s transfer of power programme, states creation and national delimitation, local government reforms and the constitutional drafting committee of the Second Nigerian Republic. In this role, he simultaneously served as the Principal Political Secretary in the Office of the President between 1976 to 1981, serving both General Olusegun Obasanjo and President Shehu Shagari. Kingibe later became the permanent secretary in charge of special services within the Cabinet Office, between 1981 to 1984.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=party-politics></span>Party politics<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kingibe entered party politics in the build-up to the transition of the Third Nigerian Republic. In 1988, he was made director of organization of the People’s Front of Nigeria which consisted of politicians such as Atiku Abubakar, Bola Tinubu, Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila and Rabiu Kwankwaso, which was then led by Shehu Musa Yar’Adua. The front later joined with the Social Democratic Party in 1989.</p><p>During the conduct of elections for national executive positions in the party, Kingibe was sponsored by the People’s Front faction of SDP as the party’s chairman, a position he went on to clinch. As party chairman, Kingibe was involved in the organization of party’s gubernatorial and presidential primaries in 1991 and 1992 respectively.</p><p>In September 2006, Kingibe returned to Nigeria and joined the Peoples Democratic Party ahead of the 2007 presidential election, won by Umaru Yar’Adua, it was widely believed that Kingibe considered running for president, before later joining the Yar’Adua administration.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1993-presidential-election></span>1993 presidential election<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>However, after the cancellations of presidential elections in 1992 in which Shehu Yar’Adua was a candidate, Kingibe put himself forward as a presidential candidate. He made a split from his initial camp, the PFN group and used his relationships with SDP state party chairmen to build his campaign. He lost the keenly contested primary conducted in Jos but after much prodding from SDP governors, he was selected by the primary winner, MKO Abiola as Vice-presidential running mate, creating a Muslim-Muslim ticket which was initially thought to be a deal breaker in the general elections. The pair won the electoral majority although the result was annulled by abdicating president General Ibrahim Babangida.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=abacha-administration></span>Abacha administration<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kingibe later joined the Abacha administration as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 1995, Minister of Internal Affairs from 1995 to 1997, and Minister of Power and Steel from 1997 to 1998.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=secretary-to-the-government></span>Secretary to the Government<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In June 2007, he was appointed Secretary to the Government of the Federation. He was unceremoniously removed from office on September 8, 2008 by the President Umaru Yar’Adua, after spreading rumors about the President’s ill-health while believed to be contending for the presidency.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=buhari-administration></span>Buhari administration<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kingibe has been a powerful behind the scenes decision-maker in the Buhari administration, alongside chief of staff Abba Kyari.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=honours></span>Honours<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><th>Country</th><th>Decoration</th><th>Presenter</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tbody></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fl66jrYygmKeZXaC2r7PIm5xmmpmktLOtz6GwZp6RmMFur8CrnJ6qXZbEor7DrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkmqaUYrmqssRmqq2noq58</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbaba-gana-kingibe-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbaba-gana-kingibe-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbaba-gana-kingibe-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbaba-gana-kingibe-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbaba-gana-kingibe-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbaba-gana-kingibe-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./catelynn-lowell-honors-daughter-carly-on-her-14th-birthday-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./catelynn-lowell-honors-daughter-carly-on-her-14th-birthday-pics.html>Catelynn Lowell Honors Daughter Carly on Her 14th Birthday: Pics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./amazon-sequin-sweatshirt-is-festive-in-a-low-key-way.html>Amazon Sequin Sweatshirt Is Festive in a Low-Key Way</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./amazon-sequin-sweatshirt-is-festive-in-a-low-key-way.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
