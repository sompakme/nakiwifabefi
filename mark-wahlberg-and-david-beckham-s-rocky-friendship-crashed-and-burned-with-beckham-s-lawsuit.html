Stars like <strong><a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a></strong> and Tobey Maguire, and George Clooney and <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong>, are just some examples of friendships that have stood the test of time.</p><p>However, just like celebrity romances, not all friendships are built to last. When they come apart at the seams, it is not quiet and there is drama involved. The beef between the former friends gets leaked and the issues become public knowledge and what could have been squashed blows further out of proportion.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/david-beckham-presents-the-new-ss24-eyewear-campaign.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="David Beckham Wins Multi-Million Designer Counterfeit Lawsuit">David Beckham Wins Multi-Million Designer Counterfeit Lawsuit</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>In a lawsuit that defended both the soccer star's earnings and his integrity, David Beckham's team fought relentlessly and won.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Mark Wahlberg</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>David Beckham</a></strong> were once friends, but now they are fighting over money.

It was not because of a lack of celebrities. After all, people like Wahlberg, <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong>, Denzel Washington, and more lived there. But it was Beckham's superstar status due to soccer that put him in a completely different celebrity stratosphere. Because of this, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crowds flocked to the exclusive Beverly Hills neighborhood in droves</a>, which completely annoyed Wahlberg.</p><p>"Man, the Beckhams. It used to be so quiet on my road," Wahlberg explained in 2009. "Then David moves in with his family. Suddenly we've got paparazzi hanging out day and night. Now they'll follow any car that drives down the road. I take strong exception to that kind of thing. When I take my kids to the park I don't want strangers sticking their lenses into our faces."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mark-wahlberg-raising-an-eyebrow.jpg><p>Wahlberg went on to say, "I'm not telling Beckham to take his family home. I'm just not sure why he came to America in the first place. Man, we don't want your soccer. There's no way Americans are going to buy the idea of 90 minutes of running around without much happening. Thanks for trying guys, but we'll stick to baseball and basketball."</p><p>When the interview came out, Wahlberg recognized that the piece sounded like he was angry at Beckham. Yet it later seemed clear that Wahlberg wasn't salty. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wahlberg eventually met up with Beckham</a> for something work-related. It was then that the two hit it off and became friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He (Beckham) wanted me to email him about something – I don’t know if it was a film.

Given that F45 was worth hundreds of millions, this would have meant millions of dollars going into Beckham's pocket.</p><p>Conversely, having Beckham as an ambassador should have brought millions not only to F45 but to Wahlberg as well. It looked to be a partnership made in heaven.</p><p>However, as the date for F45 going public drew closer, Beckham claimed he still had not received his stocks. Beckham was essentially doing work and not getting paid for it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mark-wahlberg-publicly-called-out-david-beckham-years-before-the-fame-athlete-sued-the-hollywood-superstar-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This caused a strain on the stars' friendship. But, it was not until several months after the stock went public that Beckham got truly upset. This is because in February 2022, the stock dropped drastically in valuation. Additionally, F45 had reportedly mismanaged money. The net worth of the company had gone down dramatically.</p><p>In all, according to Beckham, the delay in getting paid his "nearly one million shares of stock" cost him $9.3 million. Beckham was upset that he was not only not compensated but that what he was supposed to be compensated with was only worth a fraction of what was promised.</p><h2 id=david-beckham-39-s-company-is-suing-f45-not-mark-wahlberg>David Beckham's Company Is Suing F45, Not Mark Wahlberg</h2><h3 id=while-db-ventures-limited-is-suing-f45-it-is-still-david-beckham-suing-mark-wahlberg-at-the-end-of-the-day>While DB Ventures Limited is suing F45, it is still David Beckham suing Mark Wahlberg at the end of the day</h3><p>Beckham's company, DB Ventures Limited is the company that has brought the lawsuit against F45. While some look at this as just doing business as Beckham is not suing Wahlberg directly, if Beckham's lawsuit is successful, it will affect Wahlberg's bottom line. At the end of the day, <a href=#>the lawsuit that has Victoria admitting she is a "miserable cow"</a> is Beckham versus Wahlberg.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Essentially, to be brand ambassador, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beckham agreed to close to one million shares of stock</a>. This stock was to be paid within six months of F45 going public. Not only was Beckham not paid at that time, by February 2022, the stock had tanked. Beckham lost millions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/david-beckham-london-premiere-of-netflix-series-the-gentlemen.jpg><p>Beckham claims in his lawsuit that he was also supposed to be given another "$5 million in stock shares as of July 2022." This was never paid to Beckham. He is looking to be paid $14.5 million by F45.</p><p>F45 has claimed that Beckham did not hold up his end of the contract with the company. Because of this, F45 tried to have the lawsuit thrown out. But, the judge found that Beckham did all that was required of him, per his contract. The case is still moving forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that neither Wahlberg nor Beckham will want to go to trial, it would not be surprising for the two companies to settle before a trial date is assigned. Whether Beckham or Walhberg will come out victorious does not seem to matter when it comes to their friendship, because the two are already on the outs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51doq6zt4ywmKGkkpq%2FqHnDmq2inF2XsqS3x5qkZp6inrKvsNJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmark-wahlberg-and-david-beckham-s-rocky-friendship-crashed-and-burned-with-beckham-s-lawsuit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmark-wahlberg-and-david-beckham-s-rocky-friendship-crashed-and-burned-with-beckham-s-lawsuit.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmark-wahlberg-and-david-beckham-s-rocky-friendship-crashed-and-burned-with-beckham-s-lawsuit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmark-wahlberg-and-david-beckham-s-rocky-friendship-crashed-and-burned-with-beckham-s-lawsuit.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmark-wahlberg-and-david-beckham-s-rocky-friendship-crashed-and-burned-with-beckham-s-lawsuit.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmark-wahlberg-and-david-beckham-s-rocky-friendship-crashed-and-burned-with-beckham-s-lawsuit.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./robert-metcalfe-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./robert-metcalfe-net-worth-therichest.html>Robert Metcalfe Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./josh-meyers-says-demi-moore-ruined-that-70s-show-finale-scene.html>Josh Meyers Says Demi Moore Ruined 'That '70s Show' Finale Scene</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./josh-meyers-says-demi-moore-ruined-that-70s-show-finale-scene.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
