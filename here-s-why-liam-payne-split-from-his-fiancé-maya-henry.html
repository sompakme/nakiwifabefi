The singer has had a number of public relationships, including his most recent with the model, Maya Henry.</p><p>Prior to his time with Henry, Payne had a tumultuous time with his ex-girlfriend and baby mama, singer, Cheryl Cole, proving his romances don't always end very well. Now, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam and Maya officially calling it quits</a>, fans are wondering what really happened between the two.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘Here For Liam’ Trends On Twitter After Liam Payne Announces He’s Single Again</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-liam-amp-maya>What Happened Between Liam & Maya?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liam Payne is notably one of the biggest pop stars in the industry, and rightfully so! The star found success back in 2010 when he had auditioned for The X Factor in the United Kingdom, where he would later go on to become part of One Direction.</p><p>Prior to this, Liam had auditioned for the series two years prior, meeting X Factor judge, Cheryl Cole for the very first time. After returning for a second go, Liam was put through as a solo artist, only to be given the boot and later put into a group.</p><p>This is where One Direction first began, but more importantly, where Cheryl and Liam first met one another. The duo would go on to start dating in 2016, sparking a lot of talk around their relationship and 10 year age difference.</p><p>Their relationship quickly evolved, and Cole gave birth to their son, Bear Payne. In 2018, the couple officially split and parted ways, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving Cheryl with full custody</a> of their boy. Liam's complicated relationship with Cheryl would go on to repeat itself a second time around, but with Maya Henry, instead!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liam and Maya began dating only weeks following his split from Cheryl Cole, leaving many to wonder whether Payne jumped into another relationship too fast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘One Direction’: Liam Payne Reveals He Wants To Collaborate With His Former Band Members</a></span></p><p>The couple got serious rather quickly, and began to make appearances on one another social media and then publically! In September 2020, Liam proposed to Maya Henry, making it clear she was the one, or so we thought.</p><p>Only 10 months following their engagement news, the couple has officially broken up! Liam and Maya called it quits last week, where the singer revealed just went wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liam announced the split on Steven Barlett's podcast, The Diary Of A CEO, where he made it clear that he is the one at fault, and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is not meant to be in a relationship</a> until he's fixed himself.</p><p>“I’ve just not been very good at relationships and I know what my pattern of things is with relationships, I feel, at this point. I’m just not very good at them so I just need to work on myself before I put myself on to somebody else,” Liam told Steven.</p><p>“I’ve not really spent enough time on my own to really learn about myself. I honestly just needed a minute out to check myself," he went on to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for Liam, great things are coming up! Not only is the start, "already feeling better", as he said, but he's working on new music and focusing more on his career, and himself, rather than romance for the time being.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>One Direction Fans Think Zayn Malik Is Jealous Of Harry Styles</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmo6KZnWK9osXNnmSsqJyewW6y0aikZqCZqHqntcCnmp5lnZbGonnHnqWrsV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-why-liam-payne-split-from-his-fianc%25C3%25A9-maya-henry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-why-liam-payne-split-from-his-fianc%25C3%25A9-maya-henry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-why-liam-payne-split-from-his-fianc%25C3%25A9-maya-henry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-why-liam-payne-split-from-his-fianc%25C3%25A9-maya-henry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-why-liam-payne-split-from-his-fianc%25C3%25A9-maya-henry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-why-liam-payne-split-from-his-fianc%25C3%25A9-maya-henry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-change-gmail-theme.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-change-gmail-theme.html>How to change gmail theme</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./harry-potter-s-bonnie-wright-is-pregnant-with-her-1st-child.html>Harry Potter's Bonnie Wright Is Pregnant With Her 1st Child</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./harry-potter-s-bonnie-wright-is-pregnant-with-her-1st-child.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
