After following all the couples (and singles) through multiple episodes, countless heartbreaks, and walks down the aisle, fans often feel like they know their favorite cast members. Yet some creative editing by Netflix seems to impact the narrative in big ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result, viewers often felt blindsided when finding out cast members' true nature, or the real status of relationships, after each season ended. Mark Cuevas from season one was one of the first shockers for viewers, who seemed to believe that Netflix was being authentic and transparent with its reality dating premise.</p><h2 id=love-is-blind-39-s-mark-cuevas-was-an-unlikely-villain>Love Is Blind's Mark Cuevas Was An Unlikely Villain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-and-Mark-Love-is-Blind.jpg><p>Mark Cuevas from Love Is Blind may not have been a fan favorite early in season one. Though many viewers thought he and Jessica Batten, who he later proposed to, weren't a great fit, there were also some subtle red flags.</p><p>Those red flags became clearer when Mark "threw [Jessica] under the bus at the wedding," viewers wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the first season of Love is Blind ended, more "tea" came out about Mark, proving that there was more happening behind the scenes than viewers could have guessed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Love Is Blind May Not Have Blindsided Contestants With Its Sneaky Editing Strategies">Love Is Blind May Not Have Blindsided Contestants With Its Sneaky Editing Strategies</a></span></p><p>Part of that was due to creative editing on Netflix's part, as usually happens on reality TV, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans of the show still aren't happy about it</a>.</p><p>One wrote, "I love when a guy gets a "nice guy" edit," pointing out that Netflix's producers' goal is clearly to manipulate the narrative, whether in a positive or negative way.</p><p>Unfortunately for Jessica, the drama was edited to make her look bad, and give Mark something of a halo. But once the show ended, internet sleuths dug deeper and found out some more tea about Mark that was even more surprising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-and-jessica-broke-up-after-love-is-blind>Mark And Jessica Broke Up After Love Is Blind</h2><p>Though Mark and Jessica got engaged on Love is Blind, it obviously didn't last. The two walked down the aisle but didn't wind up married. No one was super shocked by the turn of events, especially after Jessica's "love triangle" with Amber Bennett (née Pike) and Matt Bennett.</p><p>In what some maintain was another creative series of edits, Jessica appeared to pursue Bennett long after he turned her down in the pods. Things came to a head when <a href=#>Amber confronted Jessica during the reunion special</a>, but even years later, speculation continues to swirl about whether the former co-stars are on good terms.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Are Love Is Blind's Amber Pike And Jessica Batten Still Feuding?">Are Love Is Blind's Amber Pike And Jessica Batten Still Feuding?</a></span></p><p>As for Mark, he moved on after the show, but not too far on. Cheat Sheet reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark went on to date Lauren "LC" Chamblin</a>, one of the Love is Blind cast members who didn't get an engagement arc on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Redditors apparently discovered that Mark was seeing someone else while apparently dating LC, and LC herself commented on the issue, sharing that the two were meant to be exclusive, especially amid the pandemic, but that Cuevas had broken her trust.</p><p>Jessica even offered up a comment in reply to a fan who claimed Mark was dating multiple other women while filming Love is Blind; Batten noted that she "only [knew] about one."</p><p>After these details came to light about Mark's behavior during Love is Blind and after the cameras stopped rolling, viewers had second thoughts about the way they had judged Jessica's on-air time.</p><p>As bad as Jessica came out, I wonder if we had seen unedited footage if maybe she’d come off the same way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One commenter suggested that Mark "specifically curated that edit" that made him look good, and was probably playing games the entire time the show was filming. Sadly, it seems that each season is bound to have its fakers amid people who are actually looking for love.</p><p>Case in point? <a href=#>Andrew's 'fake tears' from season three</a>.</p><h2 id=where-are-mark-cuevas-and-jessica-batten-now>Where Are Mark Cuevas And Jessica Batten Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jessica-batten-mark-love-is-blind.webp><p>Ironically, though Mark and Jessica didn't get married during LIB, they both got married in September 2022—to different people. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix confirmed in a 'where are they now' recap</a> that Mark married Aubrey Rainey. The two have two kids together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica married Benjamin McGrath (they had been dating since March 2020), noting that the whole experience was "worth the wait" to find her true love at the end of it all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Love Is Blind's Shayne Jansen's Exes Had A Lot To Say About The Reality Star">Love Is Blind's Shayne Jansen's Exes Had A Lot To Say About The Reality Star</a></span></p><p>Some other cast members have shared similar stories, but many are still looking for love, with various LIB contestants appearing on Netflix's other dating show, Perfect Match, which began airing in 2023 despite filming directly after season three of Love is Blind.</p><p>At this point, though, viewers are less sympathetic toward the perceived "good guys" from the series, especially when their behavior patterns continue through multiple reality series and even spill onto social media.</p><p>Shayne Jansen, for example, has famously feuded with his ex from Love is Blind, Natalie, and claimed she's lying on social media. Yet his actions on Perfect Match seemed to echo the same drama from LIB.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, SK, who's said to have cheated on his former fiancée Raven, <a href=#>later admitted that his relationship wasn't quite what it seemed on TV</a>.</p><p>At this point, viewers don't know what or who to believe anymore—and they can only expect more of the same from upcoming seasons of Love is Blind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoq6zt4yfqailXaOytbLLoq9mpJ%2Brsm610maZpaGemXqktMSaq2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flove-is-blind-viewers-say-they-were-blindsided-by-mark-cuevas-shocked-at-the-tea-post-season.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flove-is-blind-viewers-say-they-were-blindsided-by-mark-cuevas-shocked-at-the-tea-post-season.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flove-is-blind-viewers-say-they-were-blindsided-by-mark-cuevas-shocked-at-the-tea-post-season.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flove-is-blind-viewers-say-they-were-blindsided-by-mark-cuevas-shocked-at-the-tea-post-season.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flove-is-blind-viewers-say-they-were-blindsided-by-mark-cuevas-shocked-at-the-tea-post-season.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flove-is-blind-viewers-say-they-were-blindsided-by-mark-cuevas-shocked-at-the-tea-post-season.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ms-pat-net-worth-how-much-is-ms-pat-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ms-pat-net-worth-how-much-is-ms-pat-worth.html>Ms. Pat Net Worth How Much is Ms. Pat Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ice-spice-weight-loss-before-and-after-health-update-2023.html>Ice Spice weight Loss Before And After: Health Update 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ice-spice-weight-loss-before-and-after-health-update-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
