After all, kids are bound to pick up on the situation when their parents resent each other and then nobody will be happy. Despite that, there still are a lot of people who make that decision and it has even been reported that <a href=#>Bill Gates and Melinda Gates may have waited to divorce</a> for the benefit of their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sugar Babies And Sugar Daddies Slide Into Bill And Melinda Gates DM's Amid Split</a></span></p><p>Of course, just because it often is a bad idea for parents to remain married if they are unhappy doesn‚Äôt mean that getting divorced is an easy process for anyone. For example, for a filthy rich couple like <a href=#>Bill and Melinda Gates, dividing their assets</a> is a huge job. On top of that parents often wind up on bad terms with their children, at least for a little while, following divorce. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, was Bill Gates‚Äô relationship with his daughter Jennifer affected by his divorce from her mother?</p><h2 id=who-are-bill-gates-and-melinda-gates-rsquo-children>Who Are Bill Gates And Melinda Gates‚Äô Children?</h2><p>After Bill Gates co-founded the computer company Microsoft alongside Paul Allen, he went on to arguably become the best-known business leader in the world. More importantly than rising to fame, Bill also became wealthy beyond belief and for a long time, it seemed like everything he touched turned to gold. After all, Gates‚Äô wealth grew larger and larger over the decades, and for a long time, it seemed like he had the perfect private life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Bill Gates married Melinda Gates in 1994, the couple went on to have three kids together, Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe. Given that the Gates kids have a father who is one of the wealthiest people in human history, it seems clear that they have led very comfortable lives. That said, according to what Bill has said in the past, the trio will only inherit a small fraction of their parents‚Äô money when they pass away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Billionaire Bill Gates Is Only Leaving His Kids $10 Million Each</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the Gates kids reportedly aren‚Äôt in line to inherit billions of dollars, the trio seem to have received one thing from their parents, drive. After all, all three <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gates children seem to have done the work that is needed for them to earn their own success</a>. For example, the youngest Gates kid Phoebe has gone on to study at the elite school Stanford University. As for the Gates middle child Rory, he reportedly studied computer software engineering and economics at Duke University and then he pursued an MBA degree at Fuqua School of Business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of the time of this writing, the eldest of Bill Gates and Melinda Gates‚Äô three children seems to be the most accomplished. Of course, that makes sense since she is further along in her journey than her younger siblings. Still, Jennifer is more accomplished than most people ever will be. After all, Jennifer graduated from Stanford University and she has gone on to medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. If that wasn‚Äôt impressive enough, Jennifer also has trained to compete in equestrian show jumping and she has even represented the US on Nations Cup teams.</p><h2 id=did-bill-gates-rsquo-divorce-change-his-relationship-with-his-daughter-jennifer>Did Bill Gates‚Äô Divorce Change His Relationship With His Daughter Jennifer?</h2><p>Around the same time Bill Gates‚Äô marriage of more than fifteen years ended, there were headlines in the media that painted the business leader in a bad light. After all, it became known that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gates met with one of the most notorious and repulsive criminals of the modern age</a> several times, Jeffrey Epstein. On top of that, there also were reports that <a href=#>Bill cheated on his wife with Microsoft employees</a> over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened When Jimmy Kimmel Roasted Bill Gates?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that divorces alone are enough to make some people become estranged from their children, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if Bill Gates‚Äô daughter Jennifer resented him. When you then factor in the controversies that surrounded Bill at the same time, it almost would be surprising if Jennifer and Bill‚Äôs relationship didn‚Äôt sour. Based on what Jennifer wrote on Instagram a few months after her parent‚Äôs divorce was finalized, however, she still seems to be on great terms with her father Bill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>‚ÄúHappy happy 66th @thisisbillgates ‚ú® ü•≥ Grateful to learn from your example of endless curiosity, constant exploration and desire to help humanity.
