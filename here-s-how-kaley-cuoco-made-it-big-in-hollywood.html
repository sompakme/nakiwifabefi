Her name is Briana, and she has a younger sister named her. As a kid, Kaley Cuoco was involved in many different activities. She started playing tennis at the young age of three and pursued a career in modeling and acting. When she was only five years old, she starred in Barbie and Oscar Meyer ads.She entered the entertainment world as a kid model and did commercial work before moving on to more substantial roles. Cuoco quickly moved up the ranks and began working in television. As an actress, she has been in films like Picture Perfect and has guest-starred on TV shows, including Northern Exposure, 7th Heaven, and My So-Called Life. Cuoco had to be homeschooled because of her demanding work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She appeared in the CBS sitcom Ladies Man, and in the 2000 TV movie Growing Up Brady, the future blonde star played a prior blonde lead, the Brady Bunch's Marcia, Maureen McCormick. Cuoco, although still a teenager, landed her first significant job. In 2002, she joined American actress Katey Sagal and <a href=#>American actor John Ritter</a> on the family comedy 8 Simple Rules cast. On the show, Cuoco portrayed one of Ritter and Sagal's adolescent daughters, with Amy Davidson and Martin Spanjers playing her sisters and brother, respectively. Despite Ritter's untimely passing in 2003, the show continued, with Season 2 devoting some time to exploring the impact of his absence. Cuoco left 8 Simple Rules around its 2005 cancellation and quickly found work on another hit series. She played Billie Jenkins, among the other supernatural characters on Charmed in season eight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the cancellation of 8 Simple Rules in 2005, Cuoco continued to focus on television roles, including a guest spot as Billie Jenkins in the first episode of the original series of Charmed. An attempt was made to create a spin-off starring her character, but producers abandoned the effort. Since The Big Bang Theory premiered not long after, it worked out well for Cuoco, even if she wasn't in the pilot.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-s-breakout-role-in-the-big-bang-theory>Kaley Cuoco’s Breakout Role In The Big Bang Theory</h2><p>Cuoco's first season as Penny on The Big Bang Theory aired in 2007. Sheldon (<a href=#>American Actor Jim Parsons</a>), Leonard (American actor Johnny Galecki), and their equally nerdy but brilliant buddies Howard (American actor Simon Helberg) and Raj (British actor Kunal Nayyar) were the main characters of the show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuoco plays as Leonard's love interest</a>, a neighbor of his and Sheldon's who is both pleasant and non-intellectual.

The show quickly gained a massive following because of its unique cast of characters and snappy storytelling. Leonard and Sheldon were in the original Big Bang pilot, but the lead female role, Katie (played by Amanda Walsh), did not fare well in ratings. To improve the pilot, it was rewritten and reshot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show became a staple on CBS, with 20 million viewers at its peak in 2015.
