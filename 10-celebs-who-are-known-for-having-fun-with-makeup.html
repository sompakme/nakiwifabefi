However, the celebrities on today’s list are doing everything but playing it safe as they tend to go for glittery eyeshadows, holographic lips, patterned eyeliner, and yes — even plenty of face jewels. Honestly, these celebs have it all figured out because at the end of the day makeup should be fun — so why not think out of the box?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of The No-Makeup Selfie" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of The No-Makeup Selfie</a></span></p><p>From musicians such as Dua Lipa and Halsey, over makeup brand owners like Rihanna and Kylie Jenner, to a surprise Hollywood star — keep on scrolling to find out just which celebrities absolutely love playing around with their makeup.</p><h2 id=dua-lipa><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dua Lipa</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off is British musician Dua Lipa who rose to fame because of her fun pop songs but also because of her bold and funky fashion and makeup choices. In the photos above, the star can be seen rocking some very daring makeup looks, but as fans already know — Dua Lipa is all about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having fun with makeup</a>!</p><h2 id=halsey><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Halsey</span></h2><p>Next on the list is musician Halsey who has undoubtedly changed her style quite a lot since her breakthrough.

In the photos above, the musician can be seen rocking some colorful glittery eyeshadow as well as very graphic white eyeliner! Halsey always rocks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incredibly quirky makeup looks</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rihanna</span></h2><p>A star who has certainly played around with makeup for a long time is musician Rihanna.

The star — who rose to fame in the past couple of years — is definitely not afraid of rocking some unusual locks, whether it’s different eyeshadows on each eye or completely bedazzled eyebrows. Doja Cat is definitely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a fashion icon</a> and major makeup inspiration!</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kylie Jenner</span></h2><p>A star that obviously deserves a spot on today’s list is reality television star and makeup mogul Kylie Jenner.

Lady Gaga is certainly a star who isn't afraid of experimenting and her makeup has honestly always been on another level!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-porter><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Billy Porter</span></h2><p>Wrapping the list up is none other than Hollywood star Billy Porter who loves playing around with his look.
