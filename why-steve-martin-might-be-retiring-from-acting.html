The multi-talented artist has been working in showbiz since the ‘60s, and achieved multiple feats across different disciplines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So accomplished is the 77-year-old, that even some of the biggest names in the world of entertainment today perceive him as an idol. Emma Stone, for instance, revealed that she had to work hard to <a href=#>keep her cool when she once ran into Martin</a>.</p><p>Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, Sarah Silverman and Mindy Kaling are among celebrities who have openly sung their praises for the veteran entertainer. Martin also notably <a href=#>shares a special relationship</a> with musician <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>, who is not only a colleague, but also a friend and mentee.</p><p>Speaking about him one time, Gomez referred to him as “humble and kind.” She also explained that she often tried to be “like a sponge around him,” in order to absorb the wealth of knowledge that he has accumulated in his decades of experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even without the external praise, Martin’s work speaks for itself, with dozens of <a href=#>massive box office hits</a> under his belt. But could it all be coming to an end, with speculation rife of his impending retirement?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Steve Martin Defends Selena Gomez After Disney Comments Received Backlash</a></span></p><h2 id=steve-martin-is-currently-starring-in-only-murders-in-the-building><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Steve Martin Is Currently Starring In Only Murders In The Building</span></h2><p>Out of a long list of work in his professional career, Steve Martin’s latest project is Only Murders in the Building. The mystery comedy series airs on Hulu, and is currently wrapping up the latter of two, ten-episode seasons.</p><p>Martin is also a co-creator and writer on the show. It is on this set where he met Selena Gomez, and <a href=#>they have practically become BFFs</a> since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-steve-martin-planning-to-retire><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Is Steve Martin Planning To Retire?</span></h2><p>The rumors of Steve Martin retiring soon came after an interview he did with the Hollywood Reporter recently. In the conversation, the actor confirmed that despite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a late-career surge</a>, he was in fact contemplating walking away from it all.</p><p>Although he stopped short of admitting he was officially retiring, he admitted: “I’m not going to seek other movies. I don’t want to do cameos. This is, weirdly, it.”</p><h2 id=what-are-steve-martin-rsquo-s-biggest-career-roles><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>What Are Steve Martin’s Biggest Career Roles?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is almost impossible to pick out one movie as the absolute best of Steve Martin’s career. In lists containing his most notable work, however, The Jerk almost always comes near the top of the list. The comedy film achieved sensational success after its 1979 release, although <a href=#>Paramount Pictures nearly canceled the entire project</a> before it began.</p><p>Martin’s other most memorable movies include Planes, Trains and Automobiles, All of Me, The Pink Panther, and many more.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will Audiences Be Tickled Pink By The Upcoming 'Pink Panther' Reboot?</a></span></p><h2 id=steve-martin-is-also-a-theater-legend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Steve Martin Is Also A Theater Legend</span></h2><p>On top of his innumerable on-screen achievements, Steve Martin has also made a legacy for himself as a stage actor. He first starred in a play in 1988, when he played Vladimir in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He did not return to stage until 2002, but he would go on to be a regular on the scene for the decade-and-a-half that followed. His 2014 play Bright Star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned him two Tony Award nominations</a>.</p><h2 id=steve-martin-started-out-as-a-stand-up-comedian><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Steve Martin Started Out As A Stand-Up Comedian</span></h2><p>Before all his other accomplishments, Steve Martin was originally a stand-up comedian. His first official gig was on the show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, where his then girlfriend helped him to get a writing gig.</p><p>After transitioning to actual performing, he became one of the biggest stand-up comedians of the ‘60s and ‘70s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-later-retired-from-stand-up-to-focus-on-acting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Later Retired From Stand-Up To Focus On Acting</span></h2><p>Steve Martin already proved that he knows when to stop, after deciding to quit stand-up just when he was hitting the heights. He made the choice in order to focus fully on his acting.</p><p>The decision was vindicated from the beginning, as it was around that time that he featured in The Jerk, which would turn out to be a very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">huge critical and commercial success</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These 8 Celebrities Started Out As Stand-Up Comedians</a></span></p><h2 id=steve-martin-returned-to-the-industry-in-2016><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Steve Martin Returned To The Industry In 2016</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a three-decade hiatus – and unparalleled success as an actor, Steve Martin finally returned to stand-up comedy in 2016. He first performed a ten-minute <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opening set for Jerry Seinfeld</a>, before embarking on a national tour alongside fellow comedian Martin Short.</p><p>The tour saw the pair bag a Netflix special titled Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life.</p><h2 id=steve-martin-is-also-an-author-and-musician><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Steve Martin Is Also An Author And Musician</span></h2><p>Steve Martin’s versatility can be demonstrated through his music, as well as a host of books and scripts that he has written. His first two albums were recorded in 1977 and 1978 respectively, and both ended up selling platinum.</p><p>Martin’s bibliography includes a host of novels, a memoir and collections of essays and short stories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steve-martin-has-won-numerous-prestigious-awards><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Steve Martin Has Won Numerous Prestigious Awards</span></h2><p>Steve Martin’s body of work has seen him win numerous awards in his career.
