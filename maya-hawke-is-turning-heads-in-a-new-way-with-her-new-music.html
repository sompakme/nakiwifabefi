She was surely known before as being the child of two movie stars, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke, but she has now made a name and career all for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides acting, she also has recently released a new music video, and it has people and critics talking big time. Read on to find out why the video made such a stir.</p><h2 id=how-maya-hawke-has-risen-to-fame-so-quickly>How Maya Hawke Has Risen To Fame So Quickly</h2><p>Maya Hawke is the child of world-renowned superstars, but she also has a wonderful career. She is an actress, model, and singer/songwriter. She has starred in films including three new ones that are all expected to come out soon and has been on television as well. <a href=#>She starred in the television miniseries of Little Women</a>, playing the main character Jo March.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Keery Kept The Character Of Steve Harrington From Getting Axed Off Stranger Things</a></span></p><p>Her music career launched in 2019 when she first released a single, and she has continued to make music and even starred in several music videos. Her debut studio album, Blush, was released in 2020 and her second studio album, Moss, will release in September 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has won an award for her role as Robin in Stranger Things and quickly became a loved character on the show. She is an openly queer character on the Netflix show which fans were super excited about. Amongst all of her acting and music accomplishments, right now all people are talking about is her newest music video.</p><h2 id=maya-39-s-new-music-video-is-being-widely-talked-about>Maya's New Music Video Is Being Widely Talked About</h2><p>Hawke's music video for a single off of Moss titled, Thérèse. The music video was directed by Brady Corbet and stars Hawke throughout the entire video. The video was filmed for two days in Upstate, New York. In the video, Hawke is topless and roaming around the woods in the darkness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That alone already attracted the media's attention to the video. But even more, shocking things occur in the video as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Matthew Modine Initially Treated Millie Bobby Brown Like A Child On The Set Of Stranger Things</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the five-minute video, Hawke is leading a group of people through the woods</a> after an orgy that just occurred, which again brought the most attention to the video. It was a new and groundbreaking concept for a video, but the meaning behind it was an even more important message.</p><p>In an interview about the music video, Hawke made it clear that the video reflected what is going on currently in politics. At the premiere of the video, a letter with resources to Planned Parenthood and The Trevor Project was included to spread awareness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She commented on the video by saying, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"We are all bombarded with negative and doctored images of bodies all the time, whether we want to be or not."</a> So while the public is freaking out over the "explicitness" of the video, it actually embodies a much deeper meaning and message.</p><p>Hawke has previously commented on everything that is happening politically as well, so it makes sense for her to show her beliefs and messages throughout her art. Her father, Ethan Hawke had a comment about the video as well.</p><p>One of the hosts of The View asked him how he felt about his daughter being naked in her newest music video. To which he responded, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"She’s a full grown woman. She can do as she pleases. She can tell her truth. She can sing her song."</a></p><p>Clearly, Hawke has the support of her parents and her fans despite the negative comments she has been receiving for the video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-maya-hawke-up-to-besides-stranger-things>What's Maya Hawke Up To Besides Stranger Things?</h2><p>Hawke has a lot of wonderful upcoming projects that of course include starting Strangers Things season five which will be the last season and preparing for her new album to come out in September. She is also going to be starring in a film that is <a href=#>written and directed by Wes Anderson.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Maya Hawke Is Jealous Of Her Parents But Takes Their Business Advice, Anyway!</a></span></p><p>She will also star in a new Netflix film that is based on a 1950s thriller novel written by Patricia Highsmith.
