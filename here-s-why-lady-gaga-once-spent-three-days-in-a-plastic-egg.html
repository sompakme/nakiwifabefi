In fact, some have attended her shows so much that the Bad Romance singer actually recognizes many of her fans when she sees them, and has even sung their names while performing. Her success has also allowed her to amass a staggering net worth, estimated to sit at around $320 million, much of which comes from music sales and tour sales.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-has-become-well-known-for-her-wild-performances>Lady Gaga Has Become Well Known For Her Wild Performances</h2><p>With hoards of dedicated fans following her around the world across a string of sold-out shows, it is clear that Lady Gaga certainly knows how to put on an incredible performance.</p><p>The Poker Face singer's capabilities have been formally and globally recognized across the board, with her latest tour, the <a href=#>Chromatica Ball, garnering worldwide attention</a> and countless highly rated reviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Critics from The Guardian awarded the highly successful tour 4/5 stars, labeling it as a 'bombastically hit-stacked show that also creates an intimate human connection'.</p><p>In addition to her spectacular shows, <a href=#>Gaga has also won countless awards over the course of her career</a>, for both her musical and on-screen achievements. Some of these awards include the Oscars season award for her role in House of Gucci, twelve Grammy Awards, Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Mini-series and Billboard Music Award for Woman of the Year, among countless others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of her most notable performances was her 2009 VMA performance, which garnered much attention from both the media and the public. Later noted as one of her 'greatest live performances ever', Gaga took to the stage to perform her hit single Paparazzi.</p><p>The eccentric yet powerful performance ended with Gaga staggering across the stage covered in blood, screaming as her dancers hung her up from a rope on stage before the eyes of a very shocked and confused audience.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Lady Gaga’s Acting Career Goes Far Beyond A Star Is Born">Lady Gaga’s Acting Career Goes Far Beyond A Star Is Born</a></span></p><p>However, this is not the singer's only show-stopping performance.

Some people thought it was weird. I thought it was magical. I love Gaga."</p><p>Once again, her artistic idea set the media alight, with her performance garnering swathes of media attention, becoming one of the talked about moments during the 2011 Grammy Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=being-inside-the-egg-helped-gaga-to-39-stay-focused-39>Being Inside The Egg Helped Gaga To 'Stay Focused'</h2><p>So why exactly did Gaga decide to turn up in an egg, or more artistically known as vessel, to the 2011 awards show? While the idea may be easily brushed off by many as another one of Gaga's eccentric ideas, it turns out that there was actually a deeper meaning behind this particular artistic choice.</p><p>In an interview dating back to 2011 on KIIS FM, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaga explained that being inside the egg was a 'very creative experience'</a>, adding: “It was time for me to really prepare and think about the meaning of the song and get prepared for the performance. I really wanted to be born on stage. The creative vessel was helpful for me to stay focused. We had it backstage so that I was able to really stay in this sort of creative, embryonic incubation.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diving further in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaga also revisited the iconic look with British Vogue</a> in a YouTube video, explaining: “I was in the egg for three days. To be honest, at award shows, especially during this time, I didn’t like to talk to people. I always felt that it threw me off with my performance so this in a lot of ways is really representative of my devotion to my craft in that I really wanted to be with myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecuam7Jll5a0onnDqGStoJVitLOtzKawrGWZo3qiuoyenqBn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-why-lady-gaga-once-spent-three-days-in-a-plastic-egg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-why-lady-gaga-once-spent-three-days-in-a-plastic-egg.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-why-lady-gaga-once-spent-three-days-in-a-plastic-egg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-why-lady-gaga-once-spent-three-days-in-a-plastic-egg.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-why-lady-gaga-once-spent-three-days-in-a-plastic-egg.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-why-lady-gaga-once-spent-three-days-in-a-plastic-egg.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-mom-ended-and-why-anna-faris-didn-t-return.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-mom-ended-and-why-anna-faris-didn-t-return.html>How 'Mom' Ended and Why Anna Faris Didn't Return</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./deryck-whibley-net-worth-therichest.html>Deryck Whibley Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./deryck-whibley-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
