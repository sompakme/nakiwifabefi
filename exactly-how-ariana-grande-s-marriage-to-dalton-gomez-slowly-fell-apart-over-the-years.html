Grande's powerhouse voice, enchanting stage presence, and down-to-earth personality have separated her from many of her peers in the industry. Given Ariana Grande's level of fame, scrutiny about her personal life has often made headline news; that's what happened when she married real estate agent Dalton Gomez.</p><p>While many fans were thrilled for Grande that she seemingly found the love of her life, some were shocked that given her celebrity and young age, she would choose to settle down with someone not in the public eye. Before Gomez, Grande had relationships with some of the hottest celebrities in town, including rapper Big Sean. Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez ultimately called it quits after only a few years of marriage. But what went wrong in their seemingly happy relationship?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-ariana-grande-dating-someone-else-when-she-met-dalton-gomez>Was Ariana Grande Dating Someone Else When She Met Dalton Gomez?</h2><p>Ariana Grande was dating Michael "Mikey" Forster, musician and member of the hip-hop duo Social House, before she dated Dalton Gomez. Forster's band had performed at Grande's Sweeteners World Tour.</p><p>The team also produced some of Ariana Grande's biggest hit singles, including "Thank U, Next," which ironically was a song about the men Grande had dated. Michael Forster often praised Grande on social media, revealing his admiration for her talent and professionalism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ariana-grande-looking-annoyed.jpg><p>Ariana Grande and Forster were caught up in dating rumors after the latter starred as her love interest in the music video for Boyfriend, a song that Social House also produced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans couldn't get over their chemistry, as one part of the music video had them sharing a passionate kiss. Shortly after Boyfriend was released, speculated if Ariana Grande and Michael Forster were dating.</p><p>Despite Grande's brother dispelling rumors that they were an item, the paparazzi caught the two walking hand in hand together at Disneyland; this reveal forced Ariana Grande's team to confirm that the two were casually seeing each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar49800480-1.jpg><p>Grande and Forster's relationship ended abruptly after almost a year of dating. A source close to the 7 Rings singer discussed Grande and Forster's relationship in an exclusive interview with The Hollywood Reporter:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Ariana and Mikey were a fling that was fun, but it wasn't ever going to lead into something super serious. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana really liked Mikey</a>, but she wasn't head over heels over him.

The two reportedly met after Grande needed someone to assist her in purchasing a new home, and she was promptly introduced to Gomez. According to a source in US Weekly:</p><p>"When [Grande] saw [Gomez], she immediately<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> thought he was cute </a>and very good-looking, and she asked her team to set up an in-person meeting with him.

Not long after the news broke, Grande and Gomez relented and decided to go public with their romance, and the happy couple began sharing pictures of each other on Instagram.</p><p>After only a few months of dating, Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez were married in a small and intimate wedding at their home in California.</p><h2 id=inside-ariana-grande-39-s-marriage-to-dalton-gomez>Inside Ariana Grande's Marriage To Dalton Gomez</h2><p>"Thankful for so much love," Ariana Grande wrote about her then-husband, Dalton Gomez, on her Instagram page. The caption featured a video of the love birds embracing after celebrating the talented singers' birthday.</p><p>A confidante of Ariana Grande later shared details about Grande's and Gomez's relationship to US Weekly:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He is the type of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">type of guy [Ariana]</a> has been looking for.

The two would often showcase their love for each other on social media. But other than those incidences, they stayed relatively quiet about their personal lives.</p><p>The couple also had, at least for a time, a loving relationship as featured in Ariana Grande's hit single with Justin Beiber titled Stuck With U. In the video, fans got a glimpse inside Grande's and Gomez's relationship as they were pictured embracing at the end of the video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dalton Gomez May Be A Completely Different Man After His Separation From Wife Ariana Grande</a></span></p><p>In the early years of their marriage, there was no reason to suppose that Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez had anything other than a fairytale-like romance. However, rumors began to circulate online that Gomez was <a href=#>behaving like a bachelor</a> in a club despite still being married to Grande at that time. The gossip was never proven true or false; however, that didn't prevent the media from implying that the two had been living apart for some time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ariana-grande-didn-t-receive-special-celebrity-treatment-when-she-attended-this-iconic-restaurant.jpg><p>However, work-related issues ultimately were the straw that broke the camel's back in Ariana Grande's and Dalton Gomez's marriage.
