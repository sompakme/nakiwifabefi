It’s been a not-so-little secret since the dawn of film making. Assistants and directors have told numerous stories about how they’ve had to put up with actors’ egos and antics. Some of these stories make you think that they act more like toddlers than adults.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There’s the actress who requested a private jet for just their clothes. Others are notorious for holding up production while they sleep off last night’s party. Then, there are the actors who throw temper tantrums when they have to work with another actor or actress that they don’t like. That’s right, while the rest of us have to endure working with someone that we can’t stand, actors only have to say the word to have a team ensure that they never have to see each other on set.</p><p>Sometimes, these actors just did not get along the first time they worked together. These spats have caused actresses to leave their television shows because they could not stand being with their co-star. Other actors have stopped sequels to their popular film from ever happening just to avoid working with another actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, there are the actresses and actors whose feud is so bad that they can’t even be seated in the same row at award ceremonies. Can you guess whom we’re talking about? Let’s just say that their feelings might have blossomed and died outside of the set. Read on to test your knowledge about celebrity feuds. We bet you don’t know which ‘actress’ Tina Fey can’t stand.</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-and-vince-vaughn><strong>Reese Witherspoon And Vince Vaughn</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> and <a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a> were doomed from the beginning. They’re as different as winter and summer and it made their working relationship difficult. Reese is known in Hollywood as ‘icy’ and ‘type-A’. Vince is ‘laid back’ and often ‘unprepared’, because he just wants to have fun. So, when the duo was paired together for ‘Four Christmases’ they found each other to be ‘entirely vile’.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They were forced to act as a couple, forced to visit all four of their divorced parents over the holidays and the movie proved too much. The hatred was so intense that a source said, "Sometimes Vince will be standing behind her and he has this look on his face that he just wants to kill her!" Once the film wrapped up, Vince refused to promote the movie leaving Reese to promote the film alone</p><h2 id=martin-lawrence-and-tisha-campbell><strong>Martin Lawrence And Tisha Campbell</strong></h2><p>You might remember <a href=#>Martin Lawrence</a> as the wisecracking Martin Payne on the Fox series ‘Martin’. Not only was he an actor playing the lead character, but he was also a writer and producer. <a href=#>Tisha Campbell</a> was practically his sidekick, popularly known for her role as Regina "Gina" Waters-Payne on the series.</p><p>Martin and Tisha acted as a couple on the TV series and were also good friends offset. Then, problems between the duo rose when Tisha became engaged to Martin. Rumor has it that Martin was deeply in love with Tisha, but he found out the feeling wasn't mutual. The couple fell apart and she became engaged to someone else. Martin turned into a jealous maniac and&nbsp;went a little crazy on his one time lover even on set. Tisha Campbell filed harassment allegations against Martin. Years later they both remarried and found a way to become friends again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-anniston-and-leslie-mann><strong>Jennifer Anniston And Leslie Mann</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Anniston and <a href=#>Leslie Mann</a> are both female actresses known for their quirky and ‘cute’ roles. If two actresses in the film industry seem destined to be friends, it’d be these two. Unfortunately, they’re not and no one knows exactly why. Jennifer has expressed interest in working with the comedian’s even funnier husband, Judd Apatow in another feature film. Although, Jennifer put her foot down when she refused to work with Leslie.</p><p>A source revealed to ‘Radar’, “Jen longs to star in a comedy with her friend Elizabeth Banks, but a major stumbling block is that Judd might want Leslie to be in the movie too. Leslie is friends with neither Jen nor Elizabeth, and she’s infamous among Hollywood circles for not getting along with his leading ladies.” Yes, we can see why Jen would want to avoid that potential drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harrison-ford-and-josh-harnett><strong>Harrison Ford And Josh Harnett</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Harrison Ford</a> is rumoured to be a very difficult personality to work with because he constantly gets into catfights with his co-stars, producers, and directors. His list of people that he’s offended over the years includes Shia LaBeouf, George Lucas, and Ridley Scott.</p><p>Now, Josh Harnett, one of Hollywood’s favorite raspy-voiced hunks, starred in a film with the iconic actor and vowed to never do it again. Harrison developed a particularly bad relationship with his young co-star on the set of their film "Hollywood Homicide" in 2003. “There were times we would end up sitting in the car when we were supposed to be doing a scene and neither of us would say anything for an hour,” Harnett said. There was also tension between the two leads when they were promoting the film too. No wonder most of us haven’t heard of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wesley-snipes-and-ryan-reynolds><strong>Wesley Snipes And Ryan Reynolds</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Wesley Snipes</a> was an in-demand actor during the early 90s cementing his fame with the cult film ‘Blade’. It also cemented his reputation as being difficult to work with. <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> joined him in the third instalment of the ‘Blade’ franchise and furthered the rumors about Wesley’s bad reputation with his colleagues.</p><p>Wesley is said to be such a diva that he does not speak with his colleague's face to face. Instead, he asks his assistant to do the talking. Ryan has mentioned that working on-set for ‘Blade’ was not easy, as Wesley always had a way of calling him names like ‘cracker’ and making statements like "tell that cracker to get his line straight." Needless to say, the duo did not turn out to become close friends and Wesley soon found roles drying up in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=alec-baldwin-and-kim-basinger><strong>Alec Baldwin And Kim Basinger</strong></h2><p>Alec Baldwin and <a href=#>Kim Basinger</a> met on the set of the movie ‘The Marrying Man’ in 1990 and got married three years later. Their marriage was blessed with a child, but Kim filed for divorce in 2001, probably due to Alec’s anger problems. While we can’t say whether or not it was the cause for sure, we kind of think so after listening to the tape that she leaked of him verbally harassing their child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The famous duo fought for the custody of their child and was eventually given joint custody in 2002. Although, Alec was ordered by the court to attend anger therapy and parenting school. Recently it seems the feud between the ex-couple has come to an end, as Alec now in his late fifties and has calmed down a bit. He remarried a yoga instructor and is expecting his third child.</p><h2 id=julia-roberts-and-nick-nolte><strong>Julia Roberts And Nick Nolte</strong></h2><p>Ask <a href=#>Julia Roberts </a>what she thinks of <a href=#>Nick Nolte</a> and she’ll call him ‘completely disguising’. Nick didn’t have any kind words about the actress either, saying that Roberts is ‘not a nice person and everyone knows that.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two actors met on the set of their romantic blockbuster ‘I Love Trouble’. They played newspaper reporters who didn’t get along but eventually found themselves falling in love. Yet, in real life, the two leads hated each other. In fact, it was so bad between them that they had to shoot some of their scenes separately. Just in case anyone thought that they eventually became friends, Roberts, in an interview in 2009 on The Late Show with David Letterman, performed an "impression" of a former co-star throwing an expletive-heavy temper childish display. No one was surprised when the co-star in question was later revealed to be Nolte.</p><h2 id=alec-baldwin-and-shia-labeouf><strong>Alec Baldwin And Shia LaBeouf</strong></h2><p>It’s no surprise that someone who was ordered by the court to learn how to handle his anger would be on this list again. This time <a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> has upset actor and performing artist, <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf</a>. The two actors were co-stars in the Broadway production of ‘Orphans’.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shia publicly exited the production due to creative differences with Alec Baldwin. Baldwin later explained that he was attacked during rehearsal. When speaking to ‘Interview Magazine’, Shia shot back describing the situation as a heartbreak he still hasn't recovered from. Perhaps, their differences could stem from the fact that Shia frequently followed Baldwin home? That could rub anyone the wrong way. Apparently, it was Shia’s way of intimidating Baldwin, which was a part of the acting process. The two have made up and Baldwin recently reached out to LaBeouf.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-and-terrence-howard><strong>Robert Downey Jr And Terrence Howard</strong></h2><p>Things were a bit tense between <a href=#>Robert Downey Jr</a> and his former ‘Iron Man’ co-star <a href=#>Terrence Howard</a>. The pair fell out publicly when it came time for negotiations for ‘Iron Man 2’. &nbsp;At one point, Terrance suggested that Robert cost him $100 million in lost earnings.</p><p>“It turns out that the person that I helped become Iron Man when it was time for re-up for the second one, took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out,” Terrance said in an interview with ‘Rolling Stone’. “Never heard from him. And, guess who got the millions I was supposed to get? He got the whole franchise, so I’ve actually given him $100 million.” Terrance later turned the other cheek and reconciled with his former co-star at film producer Brian Grazer’s wedding. “Life is too short,” he said of the occasion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-anniston-and-angelina-jolie><strong>Jennifer Anniston And Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>We all know the story. <a href=#>Jennifer Anniston</a> was married to Brad Pitt for five years. Then, he left her for <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> when the pair was shooting their blockbuster, ‘Mr. & Mrs Smith’. The paparazzi had a field day raving about a feud between Jennifer and Angelina that has been going on since 2005. The two glamorous actresses have tried to keep away from one another. When one shows up for an event, the other seems to skip it.</p><p>Although, there was that time at the Golden Globes that Angelina awkwardly looked down when she had to sit front row while Jennifer gave a speech. Now, the ‘Friends’ star might have the last laugh. After Brad and Angelina announced their split, Jen was reported satisfied with it being her happy ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jamie-foxx-and-ll-cool-j><strong>Jamie Foxx And LL Cool J</strong></h2><p>Academy Award winner <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a> and rapper <a href=#>LL Cool J</a> have had a long-standing feud since they were both involved in a skirmish on the set 1999 movie, ‘Any Given Sunday’. The two young actors were in character mode portraying aggressive football players. They went off the script a little and Jamie, in the heat of the moment thought that it was a good idea to punch LL square in the face. Spoiler alert, it wasn’t.</p><p>Before long, angry words were exchanged and both actors were exchanging blows right on set before the rest of the crew had to pull them apart. Jamie later filed charges against LL, but thankfully the incident blew over and the two are now friends who laugh about that time Jamie was knocked out by a rapper.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-and-mariah-carey><strong>Nicki Minaj And Mariah Carey</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> are both divas and at one point in history, ‘American Idol’ judges. The producers are probably kicking themselves for thinking that the two singers with overblown personalities could work well together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicki constantly used crass language around Mariah calling her a ‘b****’ and even telling producers that&nbsp;she would be ready to actually harm her. No wonder Mariah has later described the incident as ‘abusive’. We’re not sure what drove Nicki to hate Mariah so much, but their mutual hatred for each other caused both women to leave the show after a few months. In a radio interview, Mariah later said, “I thought it was going to be a three-person panel, but it wasn’t that. It was like going to work every day in Hell with Satan.”</p><h2 id=bill-murray-and-lucy-liu><strong>Bill Murray And Lucy Liu</strong></h2><p>In the middle of shooting a scene for the 2000 film ‘Charlie 's Angels’, <a href=#>Bill Murray</a> forced the director to pause the scene. He pointed to Drew Barrymore and said "I get why you're here," then at Cameron Diaz, "And you've got talent." When he got to <a href=#>Lucy Liu</a> who played the third ‘Angel’, Alex Munday, he said, "But what in the hell are you - Lucy, doing here? You can't act."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Afterwards, Lucy got angry and started a fight by throwing a few punches at Murray for being rude. We don’t entirely blame her. Although, the physical altercations got so bad that both actors had to physically be pulled apart. It’s no wonder that Murray’s part was later replaced by Bernie Mac when the hit film was picked up for a sequel.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-and-america-ferrera><strong>&nbsp;Lindsay Lohan And America Ferrera</strong></h2><p>It got so ugly on the set of "Ugly Betty" between <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> and the popular ABC show's star, <a href=#>America Ferrera</a> that Lohan was cut from an agreed-upon six episodes to four. Apparently, Lindsay was her normal diva self-bringing an entourage, trashing dressing rooms, and refusing to show up to the set. Yet, it was the episode titled ‘Granny Pants’ that really created a real riff between the two actresses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lohan played Betty’s high school nemesis that would ‘de-pants’ her. One day, when they were rehearsing the scene the girls actually did it to one another. The problem was that Lindsay wasn’t wearing underwear and was so embarrassed that she cried. She called Ferrera ‘mean’ stating that producers gave her too much power. We think Lindsay will make sure that she doesn’t forget her to completely get dressed next time.</p><h2 id=tyrese-gibson-and-james-franco><strong>Tyrese Gibson And James Franco</strong></h2><p>Once upon a time, <a href=#>James Franco</a> was a devotee of ‘method acting’. It did not go well for him and resulted in an incident that saw him close to being pressed with assault charges. During the filming of the film, ‘Annapolis’ Franco found it difficult to snap out of character and punched his co-star Tyrese Gibson in the face. Granted, they were both playing boxers, but Franco forgot that he is not actually a boxer, but an actor playing a boxer.</p><p>"Whenever we'd have to get in the ring for boxing scenes, and even during practice, the dude was full-on hitting me", Tyrese said of the incident. James responded by saying, "I take full blame for any problems on that film. If he had a bad experience working with me, I was probably a jerk." He claims it wasn't intentional. He also added that he probably was just so wrapped up in his performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shannon-doherty-and-alyssa-milano><strong>Shannon Doherty And Alyssa Milano</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Alyssa Milano</a> and <a href=#>Shannon Doherty</a> are two seasoned television actresses who both rose to fame in their teens. Yet, years later when the actresses were paired together for the CW’s show ‘Charmed’, their experience as professional actors did not help their working relationships. They only lasted three seasons together before Doherty left in 2001 with her departure linked to behind-the-scenes tension with Milano.</p><p>The producers killed off Doherty’s character and Rose McGowan was drafted in to ‘replace’ Doherty, as a long lost sister. The exact cause of the tension is still unclear. Milano said of Doherty, “We were on the air with her for three years, and there were definitely some rough days." She also revealed on an appearance on E!’s ‘Daily Pop’, that the former feuding “Charmed” co-stars have been in touch recently after years of turmoil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-sheen-and-selma-blair><strong>Charlie Sheen And Selma Blair &nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Rumor has it that <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> was crazy about <a href=#>Selma Blair</a> before he met her. He loved the actress in ‘Cruel Intentions’ and cast her as his love interest for his new show ‘Anger Management’.</p><p>However, the actress noticed Charlie’s questionable work ethic and behavior. She complained to a friend about the actor and when her words got back to Charlie, he blew up and demanded that she had to go. A source revealed, “Selma didn’t trash Charlie on the set. Everyone on the show was ticked off at his behavior, but no one complained because they knew he would fire them. But, her private comments got back to him and he went off. It’s his show and she was let go.” Apparently, Charlie’s behavior like showing up to set late and heavy partying, came to light and his show only lasted two seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-beckinsale-and-luke-wilson><strong>&nbsp;Kate Beckinsale&nbsp;And Luke Wilson</strong></h2><p>In the year 2007 thriller ‘Vacancy’, <a href=#>Kate Beckinsale</a> and <a href=#>Luke Wilson</a> played a married couple trapped in a hotel that monitored their every move with hidden cameras. While the rest of the cast and crew got along well, the two leads had a volatile working relationship.</p><p>Kate had a few beefs with her co-star Luke. She openly admitted that she couldn't tolerate him on set. She made claims about him being rude to her on the film’s set. Sources also confirmed her claims, and also slammed Wilson for constantly showing up late for shoots or simply showing up hung over. Wilson’s poor attitude and lack of professionalism was a bad experience for Kate. Ever the professional, Kate continued shooting the film without complaining just to be able to get the job done as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker-and-kim-cattrall><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker&nbsp;And&nbsp;Kim Cattrall</strong></h2><p>Rumors have been flying about <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> and <a href=#>Kim Cattrall</a>’s relationship on the set of the ‘S*x and the City’ franchise for years. Recently, Sarah has expressed her surprise and disappointment over Kim’s statement that the two were never and are not friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the ‘Telegraph’, the tension between the two actresses was all about money. During the second season, Sarah was given an executive producer title, which bumped her salary up to $300,000. Despite her best efforts, Kim could never negotiate for the same salary that the show’s star received. Cast and crew spoke with the ‘Telegraph’ saying that Kim’s campaign for a pay raise to match Sarah’s caused so much tension that there were moments when the girls wouldn’t sit with her during lunch and dinner. Kim took to social media in 2017 to write that her and her co-stars were neither friends nor family.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-and-tina-fey><strong>Paris Hilton&nbsp;And Tina Fey</strong></h2><p></p><p>Do you remember the time that <a href=#>Tina Fey</a> dropped the ‘f-bomb’ when talking about <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>? The former SNL head writer and actress sat down with Howard Stern for his radio show and spilled all her thoughts about the heiress and television personality. Some of the highlights included calling Paris ‘a piece of s***’ and claiming that she had ‘the hair of Fraggle that left nasty wads of Barbie hair on the floor from her cheap extensions’.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tina also said that Paris ‘takes herself too seriously’ and ‘embraces her stupidity’.
