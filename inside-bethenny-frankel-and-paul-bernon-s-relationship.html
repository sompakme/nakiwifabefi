Let's take a look at Bethenny and Paul Bernon's romance.</p><h2 id=the-start-of-the-love-story>The Start Of The Love Story</h2><p>Now that Bethenny Frankel is no longer on&nbsp;RHONY, she has said that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show isn't inspiring</a>. But&nbsp;although she isn't part of&nbsp;the Bravo franchise&nbsp;anymore, her love life has been interesting, and fans have enjoyed following along.</p><p>Fans want to know more about&nbsp;Bethenny's current romance.</p><p>Bethenny and Paul Bernon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began their relationship in the fall of 2018</a>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;People, he is a movie producer and real estate developer. Fans of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of New York&nbsp;will recall Bethenny&nbsp;sharing that Dennis Shields, who she dated off and on, had passed away around that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Reality Tea,&nbsp;the star gave more details of her dating history to Andy Cohen. She said that&nbsp;because she and&nbsp;Dennis were off and on again, she would date other people.&nbsp; She said about Paul Bernon, "So last Christmas I went out on a date. I remember talking to Tinsley [Mortimer] and being like, ‘I really like him’ and I thought I was an idiot because I was saying like, ‘I don’t know. I feel like he could be like the one or something.'"</p><p>Bethenny&nbsp;said that she liked&nbsp;Paul a lot but didn't feel she was "ready" for something serious. She was worried about it not working out and all the negative emotions that would come out of that. That is something that&nbsp;her single fans can relate to, for sure, as it can be tough to have a broken heart and to keep trying to find someone.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives Of New York City Sorted Into Their Hogwarts Houses</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-break-up-and-getting-back-together>The Break-Up And Getting Back Together</h2><p>It doesn't sound like the break-up was too bad, as Bethenny Frankel appeared on&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&nbsp;and spilled a bit about what happened.</p><p>According to&nbsp;People,&nbsp;she said, "You know, not everything works out and so many people have tried to define my life — our lives — with, 'When are you getting engaged?' 'When are you having a baby?' 'When are you getting married?' And I've just realized more in life, with people being more open and honest about their lives and what they want, that everything doesn't have to sort of end in a blue box and a bow."</p>Bethenny also&nbsp;said, "We've had a great, great relationship and I'm really happy. Not everything has to end badly, some things just don't continue and it's not negative, it's just life."<p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Andy Cohen Want More Cities Of The ‘Real Housewives’?</a></span></p><h2 id=bethenny-in-love>Bethenny In Love</h2><p>In early 2021, Bethenny Frankel shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Paul Bernon got back together</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Valentine's Day, Bethenny posted a photo of the couple and wrote,&nbsp;“Behind every woman… (you fill in the blanks here.)

You don’t have to like every cheesy movie, but [you need to find] a person who makes you want to be a better person. [Who] makes you want to be nice to them, love them, and take care of them – and vice versa."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Chastain Revealed She Wouldn’t Want To Work With This Real Housewife</a></span></p><p>After saying goodbye to the&nbsp;Real Housewives of New York, Bethenny Frankel told&nbsp;Hollywood Life&nbsp;that she felt more peace.
