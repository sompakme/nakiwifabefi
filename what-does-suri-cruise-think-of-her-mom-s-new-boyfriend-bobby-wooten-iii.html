He spent his life creating music and has racked up quite the resume. He's worked on Broadway where his play was nominated for a Grammy, as well as performed at Coachella alongside Carly Rae Jepsen. He's most notable for being a bass player.</p><p>He met Katie Holmes when a mutual friend of theirs set them up on a date and by April 2022, the couple were seen in displaying tons of PDA around New York City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More recently, the pair attended a wedding where Wooten was the best man. A source who also attended the wedding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was quoted by US Magazine saying</a>, "Whenever they would go without seeing each other, they would kiss and be very happy to be together again. Katie and Bobby were very affectionate with each other at all times; they looked very in love and didn’t care who saw... Katie seemed to be carefree the entire night and very much in love with Bobby."</p><p>She was also said to be “having fun, [she] never tried to steal the spotlight and really let the bride shine”. Unfortunately, this isn't the only time a bride-to-be had to worry about Katie Holmes potentially ruining her wedding with by simply being in the picture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Shiloh Jolie-Pitt And Suri Cruise?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-holmes-has-had-her-fair-share-of-trouble-in-her-love-life>Katie Holmes Has Had Her Fair Share Of Trouble In Her Love Life</h2><p>Back in 2020, 41-year-old Katie Holmes was seen in New York City getting pretty cozy with 33-year-old chef <a href=#>Emilio Vitolo Jr</a>. The couple were spotted by paparazzi going out to dinner and sharing kisses, which were in the tabloids the following day. The only problem with this is that Emilio Vitolo Jr. was already engaged to someone at the time. Rachel Emmons, a 24-year-old designer, was Emilio's fiancé and live-in girlfriend.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an article posted by Micky AU</a>, a source who knew about the situation personally was quoted saying “Rachel was completely blindsided – she received a coldhearted breakup text from Emilio as soon as he knew the photos with Katie were going public. She knows Katie should have been aware that Emilio was engaged.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emilio and Rachel were together for nearly 2 years before their engagement was announced on Instagram in 2019. That same year, in October, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another source was quoted by Daily Mail UK</a> saying that that's when Katie and Emilio became "friendly."</p><p>"Katie definitely knew Emilio had a fiancé and started something with him while he was very much living with his fiancé... Up to this press coming out Rachel had no idea what was going on. He is a cheater, and this isn't a 'happy ending' story." Katie and Emilio split up in May 2021, a mere 8 months later.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Tom Cruise's Child Support For Suri Even Make A Dent In His Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-suri-holmes-think-of-bobby-wooten-iii>What Does Suri Holmes Think Of Bobby Wooten III?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an article posted by Hollywood Life,</a> a source close to Katie Holmes spoke openly about Suri Holmes and her true feelings about this new man her mother has introduced into her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source is quoted saying, “Katie has introduced her boyfriend Bobby to Suri and Suri absolutely approves of him. Bobby treats Suri like an adult, which she likes and Suri thinks it is great to see her mom happy... Suri is 16 years old, and she knows what love is and she knows what heartbreak is. She knows what it means when two people share a real connection and she sees this with her mother and Bobby. She is all for it. Bobby and Suri have gotten somewhat close because Katie has allowed this. He has been over to their house countless times, and he has been out with Katie and her daughter.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Interesting Facts About Katie Holmes’ Close Bond With Her Daughter, Suri Cruise</a></span></p><p>The source goes on to say, "He knows that Suri is Katie’s world, and he thinks she is a fantastic mom. He is an all-around good guy, and he has met Katie‘s entire family. They all think it is wonderful that she has found someone that does not want to keep her a secret and someone that will not be afraid to show his true feelings for her wherever they are at. She deserves this.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Katie Holmes have also seemed to approve of this new union.
