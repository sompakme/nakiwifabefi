She got married to a Swede, Mr. Olsson, who has managed to stay low key away from the spotlight, despite having famous children.</p><p>Maggie Olsson held a traditional engagement ceremony in Nanyuki back when Nowitzki proposed to Jessica. She lived long enough to see her daughter become a wife and a mother but passed away at an undisclosed date.</p><p>On the other hand, Jessica Olsson’s in-laws are celebrated sports stars in the respective games they played. Her mother-in-law, Helga Nowitzki, was a professional basketball player whereas her father-in-law, Jörg-Werner, was an international handball player.</p><p>As of her sister-in-law, Dirk Nowitzki’s older sister Silke Nowitzki, she is a former local champion in basketball as well as track and field who now works for the NBA in International TV.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-siblings></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Dirk Nowitzki’s wife is the eldest of three children born to a Swedish dad and a Kenyan mom. Her younger brothers, <strong>Marcus Olsson</strong> and <strong>Martin Olsson</strong> are twins and professional footballers who play for the Swedish national team. The twins were born on 17 May 1988, 6 years later after their elder sister was born.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-jessica-olsson-and-dirk-nowitzki></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife | Jessica Olsson and Dirk Nowitzki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jessica Olsson is married to <strong>Dirk Nowitzki</strong>. The couple tied their knot on July 20, 2012, at Nowitzki’s home in Dallas and together they are blessed with three children namely, Morris, Malaika, and Max. The family resides in Dallas, Texas.</p><p>Dirk Nowitzki and his wife are an example of love at first sight. They met at a charity event in Dallas organized by a Senegal based nonprofit, Sports for Education and Economic Development (SEED) in February 2010. During the event held at night, Nowitzki made a major donation in exchange for a Rolando Diaz painting. Besides, he agreed to go on two dates for charity and later asked Jesicca out on a date too.</p><p>Since then, the couple dated for a few years before they exchanged their nuptial vows. Race has never been an issue to them despite the race-related comments they got from people when they made their first major public appearance at The ESPYS awards red carpet on July 13, 2011.</p><p><strong>Jessica Olsson Wedding</strong></p><p>The attractive couple had two weddings, first in Kenya and later in Germany. There are no many details to share about the Germany-held wedding since it was the normal wedding routine that the duo is aware of. That is, a facilitator blessed their union and officiated the ceremony.</p><p>In Kenya, Jessica Olsson’s mother held a traditional Kikuyu wedding for her daughter and son-in-law. Hundreds of people were in attendance and witnessed the retired NBA player correctly choose his bride among 6 other women while blindfolded. The practice is orthodox at Kikuyu weddings and for each wrong pick the groom makes, he purchases a goat for slaughter.</p><p>The Kenyan-held ceremony went on for a whole day with more practices being introduced to Dirk and Jessica as they were new experiences to both of them.</p><p>Another common practice at such weddings is the dowry payment well known as “ruracio”. The grooms pay a certain agreed-upon amount of money or property to the bride’s parents. In Dirk’s case, he was given a little Kenyan shilling and paid them that. Jessica Olsson wore a traditional Kikuyu garment while Dirk Nowitzki was in a dark brown traditional outfit with orange hues.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dirk-nowitzki-wife-and-kids-jessica-olsson-children></span>Dirk Nowitzki Wife and Kids | Jessica Olsson Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since their marriage in 2012, Nowitzki’s family has grown as his wife has given birth to three beautiful kids, a daughter, and two sons.

The to-go plate is the kind that a person is sent home with when there are leftovers remaining from a party or dinner.</p><p>Dirk Nowitzki is very choosy when it comes to what he takes in as food. He has a diet he is adhering to and that is why he brings his own food from home. His loving wife is responsible for the to-go plate which her husband is often seen carrying.</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Dirk Nowitzki Wife</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-dirk-nowitzkis-wife></span><span>Who is Dirk Nowitzki’s Wife?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jessica Olsson is&nbsp;an accomplished associate director who has gained extensive recognition as the wife of famous retired German NBA player, Dirk Nowitzki</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-dirk-nowitzkis-wife></span><span>How old is Dirk Nowitzki’s Wife?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is a Swedish-Kenyan national born in 1982, in Nanyuki, Kenya.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-dirk-nowitzkis-wife></span><span>How tall is Dirk Nowitzki’s Wife?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dirk Nowitzki’s wife stands at a height of 1.54 meters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-jessica-olsson-married></span><span>Is Jessica Olsson married?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, she is married to Dirk Nowitzki.
