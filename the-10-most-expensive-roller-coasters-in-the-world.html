A smaller one, like in the Mall of America, might be worth $1-2 million, but for newer and bigger attractions at amusement parks worldwide, the price creeps closer to $20 million. <i>Fast Company</i> online magazine noted that of the world’s 2,400+ roller coasts, around 7% are made of wood; the rest made of steel, which bumps up costs.</p><p>What else besides parts makes these stomach-twisting rides so expensive to construct? It starts with the design – the research, creative, and mechanics make up the bulk of the cost. Another added fee would be licensing for movies or characters, such as Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride at Universal Studios, based on The Mummy movie franchise. Some more sophisticated rides include audio or animation, which makes them all the more entertaining but also adds more dollars to the bottom line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And that’s just the cost to build them! Once built, parks have to create budgets to operate and maintain these behemoths to ensure fun and safety for all riders. With that in mind, we’ve put together a list of the world’s most expensive roller coasters. Strap yourself in as we countdown these costly coasters.</p><h2 id=no-10-storm-coaster-aus-20-million><strong>No. 10 – Storm Coaster, AUS $20 Million</strong></h2><p>If you’re looking to get wet and wild, then Storm Coaster is a ride you’ll want to hop aboard. &nbsp;This Sea World attraction located in Gold Coast, Australia only opened its doors this past December.&nbsp;“[It’s] believed to be the largest single investment in a theme park ride in Australia,” said&nbsp;<i style=line-height:24px>TNT Magazine</i>.&nbsp;The ride has already made a splash at the park – literally. Sea World visitors have been clamouring to try out the 92 foot tall ride that ends with huge splash at 70mph.

With an initial 300 foot drop at a shocking 85 degree angle, riders are greeted to an incredible fall that’s sure to put their heart in their mouths. This intimidating coaster was voted “Best New Roller Coaster in 2010”, the year it first opened, according to <i>Amusement Today</i>. The ride is named after the legendary Dale Earnhardt (whose nickname is the intimidator) and his NASCAR career; the ride begins with his son, <a title="Dale Earnhardt Jr" href=#>Dale Earnhardt Jr</a> saying, “Gentlemen, start your engines!”</p><p></p><h2 id=no-8-top-thrill-dragster-25-million-tied><strong>No. 8 – Top Thrill Dragster, $25 million (tied)</strong></h2><p>Via: www.flickr.com</p><p>At Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio stands one of the only two strata coasters in the world. Top Thrill Dragster was a record 420 feet tall going speeds of 120 mph, making it the tallest and fastest ride in existence at its launch in 2003.

At 310 feet tall, it was the first complete-circuit ride of its kind to top 300 feet; it was also the tallest complete-circuit ride with the biggest drop. On top of height, Millennium Force had speed: it was the fastest complete-circuit ride at 93 mph. Time magazine describes it as a “beauty of a ride, with twists and turns throughout the entire 6,595-foot course”. Other firsts for the ride include the use of cable lift system and magnetic breaking system.</p><p></p><h2 id=no-6-kingda-ka-25-million-tied><strong>No. 6 – Kingda Ka, $25 million (tied)</strong></h2><p>Via: www.johnnyupsidedown.com</p><p>At Six Flags in Jackson, New Jersey, they know thrills.

This steel coaster is one of the tallest in the world, and while isn’t necessarily one of the fastest at 81mph, but it’ll have you gripping your seat as the cars zoom through the Big-O centerless Ferris wheel.</p><p>Thunder Dolphin was recently reopened after being closed for three years; it was revamped for safety during that time after a piece fell and hit a rider. Just prior to that incident, <i>Time</i> magazine named Thunder Dolphin as one of its top 10 roller coasters.</p><p></p><h2 id=no-2-steel-dragon-52-million><b>No. 2 – Steel Dragon, $52 million</b></h2><p>Via: en.wikipedia.org</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Riders were able to first board the Steel Dragon in the year of the Dragon – 2000 – at the Nagashima Spa Land amusement park in Japan.

Walt Disney World in Florida made the 2011 Guinness World Records for most expensive roller coaster, a title which hasn’t yet been broken.&nbsp; It took over six years to design and construct the ride, the storyline of which features a yeti guarding the “forbidden mountain”. When it comes to height, speed and lengths – the coaster is remarkably average. What makes this ride special is that it can go both forward and back during a single ride, not to mention the extras and set designs are much more advanced than others of its kind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGZpYGK6sL%2FTZpyxqJWjwKrCxGapqKScmr9ur86aqq2doqh6qrqMrZ%2BeZaekv62wjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-roller-coasters-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-roller-coasters-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-roller-coasters-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-roller-coasters-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-roller-coasters-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-roller-coasters-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-steve-martin-might-be-retiring-from-acting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-steve-martin-might-be-retiring-from-acting.html>Why Steve Martin Might Be Retiring From Acting</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paige-spiranac-husband-paige-spiranac-is-married-to-steven-tinoco-when-did-paige-spiranac-get-marr.html>Paige Spiranac Husband: Paige Spiranac Is Married To Steven Tinoco.
