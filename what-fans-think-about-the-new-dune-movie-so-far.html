The beautiful scenery, stunning camera work and special effects, and flattering futuristic costumes only seemed to enhance Chalamet's beguiling beauty to his fans, who took to Twitter to express their delight. One fan wrote: 'Every shot of #TimothéeChalamet in #Dune should be framed and hung in a museum.'</p><p>Others expressed their adoration over the famously handsome actor's locks, and gave their praise to the talented make-up and hair department on set: '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm never going to stop talking about Timothée Chalamet's hair in Dune</a>' wrote one admiring user on Twitter.</p><p>For many, it seems, the biggest draw for them was its star actor, and the storyline and everything else was just secondary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Roasts ‘Dune’ Creator For Complaining About HBO Max Release</a></span></p><h2 id=anther-director-highly-praised-the-movie><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Anther Director Highly Praised The Movie</span></h2><p>Amongst its many fans, Dune can also count seasoned sci-fi director Christopher Nolan. The director wrote in praise of the picture, saying “It’s one of the most seamless marriages of live action photography and computer generated visual effects that I’ve seen." He went on to praise, "the way in which it’s made is for the big screen. It’s a real pleasure and a real gift to film fans everywhere.”</p><h2 id=it-got-lots-of-fans-hyped-for-39-dune-part-two-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>It Got Lots Of Fans Hyped For 'Dune: Part Two'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dune was such a hit with fans, that it left many extremely excited for part two of the movie, which has just been officially announced.

Dune was a 'near perfect recreation of the first half of maybe the most famous sci-if novel of all time,' another said, claiming 'Villeneuve is really a master of scale, scope, and sound.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The visuals in particuar stunned fans, managing to recreate the futuristic worlds with stylistic flair.

Many credited the film's director for its success: '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Denis Villeneuve is coming to the party, you know you're getting some stunning visuals</a>' said another. Its faithfulness to the original text impressed many diehard fans of the novels, who appreciated the dedication to Frank Herbert's vision.</p><p>Hans Zimmer's emotive score also received plenty of praise.</p><h2 id=and-a-lot-of-people-were-just-obsessed-with-the-space-mouse><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>And A Lot Of People Were Just Obsessed With The Space Mouse</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most surprising online trends in reaction to Dune has been the obsession with the large-eared mouse which features prominently in the film - and will be crucial to the storyline in future movies.</p><p>The adorable mouse, which is featured running across the desert and also caring for its young inside a self-fashioned tent. Fans were delighted by the CGI creation, and shared screenshots of the rodent online, cooing over its cuteness and even calling it the 'real' star of the movie.
