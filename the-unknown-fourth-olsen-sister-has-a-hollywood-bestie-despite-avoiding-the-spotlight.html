On top of being famous for bringing a superhero to life, Elizabeth's career seems to have nearly limitless potential in the future.Thanks to everything Mary-Kate, Ashley, and Elizabeth have achieved, they've made the last name Olsen very famous. Despite that, many fans have no idea that there is a fourth Olsen sister out there, and she has a famous friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-it-was-like-for-elizabeth-olsen-to-grow-up-with-the-olsen-twins>What It Was Like For Elizabeth Olsen To Grow Up With The Olsen Twins</h2><p>Now that Elizabeth Olsen is a huge movie star, a lot of people think about Mary-Kate and Ashley as her less famous sisters. However, when Elizabeth was growing up, she was the little sister of the world-famous Olsen Twins.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Constantly Turn Down Interviews</a></span></p><p>Unsurprisingly, Elizabeth has been asked what it was like to have famous sisters several times since she became a star. During an appearance on the U.K. talk show Lorraine, Elizabeth made it clear that her sisters' fame resulted in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her and the twins having an unusual childhood</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's definitely not a lot of people's average childhood, but I don't know if any of us look back at our childhoods and think of any of them as average. I guess it was unique to me and my sisters' experience."</p><p>However, during that same interview, Elizabeth spoke about Mary-Kate and Ashley in ways that lots of younger siblings can relate to. Most notably, Elizabeth spoke about always wanting to be like her big sisters.</p><p>"Everything my sisters have ever worn in my entire life I have wanted to wear still as an adult today. I want their coats. I want their shoes. I want their dresses. And that is something that I never grew out of."</p><p>During another interview with Harper's Bazaar, Elizabeth spoke about having twin siblings. "There's something that I'll never experience of that connection, but I feel lucky to be witness to it. I actually think it's an amazing feeling, being the younger sibling to twin sisters. If I was spoiled by one, the other wanted to match it. I loved it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elizabeth also spoke about the Olsen Twins helping her to navigate life. "I felt very clear about how I was going to navigate lots of things because of watching them. I also felt very protected."</p><p>Based on everything Elizabeth has said about her famous older sisters, it seems very clear that she loves the Olsen twins deeply.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-fourth-olsen-sister-courtney>Who Is The Fourth Olsen Sister, Courtney?</h2><p>Several years after Elizabeth Olsen was born, her parents got divorced. After that, the patriarch Dave Olsen walked down the aisle again with his current wife Mackenzie Olsen and the couple went on to have two children, a son and a daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elizabeth Olsen Explains How Sisters Mary-Kate And Ashley Almost Made Her Give Up Acting</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in 1996, Courtney Taylor Olsen is the younger sister of Mary-Kate, Ashley, and Elizabeth. Unlike her older half-sisters, Courtney has never shown any public interest to date in the entertainment industry.</p><p>That said, since Courtney isn't famous, the public knows next to nothing about her. As a result, Courtney easily could have dreams of becoming rich and famous like her half-sisters without the world knowing it.</p><p>Another thing about Courtney that people know very little about is her relationships with her older sisters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To date, the only publicly available indication that Courtney currently has a relationship with her famous sisters is that she has posted photos of herself at movie premieres in the past. Thanks to posts on Courtney's Instagram page, it is clear that she attended premieres for Avengers: Infinity War and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.</p><p>As far as Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, nothing is known about whether Courtney is in contact with them. However, given that it is well known that the Olsen Twins have avoided the spotlight for years, that would make perfect sense even if Courtney talks to them daily.</p><h2 id=is-courtney-taylor-olsen-friends-with-madison-pettis>Is Courtney Taylor Olsen Friends With Madison Pettis?</h2><p>Thanks to Courtney's Instagram page, it is clear that she has an extremely close relationship with someone named Madison Pettis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Pettis has never been a household name, a generation of people adored her. Best remembered for starring in the Disney Channel show Cory in the House, Pettis also portrayed Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's daughter in The Game Plan.</p><p>Some of Pettis' other film credits include roles in Beverly Hills Chihuahua movies, American Pie Presents: Girls' Rules, and He's All That. Pettis has also played memorable roles in several other shows including Life with Boys, Lab Rats, and The Fosters.</p><p>According to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Pettis have been extremely close friends since 2012</a>. Based on the fact that Pettis makes several appearances on Courtney's Instagram page, that is easy to believe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2iqbumxYytmLKkn6d6sLjSnqVmnp%2Bqv7W0jKijrJ2eYsCqv9OeqWaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBixKrAx2akmpyUnsCwuoypnK2smah8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-unknown-fourth-olsen-sister-has-a-hollywood-bestie-despite-avoiding-the-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-unknown-fourth-olsen-sister-has-a-hollywood-bestie-despite-avoiding-the-spotlight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-unknown-fourth-olsen-sister-has-a-hollywood-bestie-despite-avoiding-the-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-unknown-fourth-olsen-sister-has-a-hollywood-bestie-despite-avoiding-the-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-unknown-fourth-olsen-sister-has-a-hollywood-bestie-despite-avoiding-the-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-unknown-fourth-olsen-sister-has-a-hollywood-bestie-despite-avoiding-the-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-the-original-cast-of-the-office-has-said-about-the-spinoff.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-the-original-cast-of-the-office-has-said-about-the-spinoff.html>What the Original Cast of The Office Has Said About the Spinoff</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./prince-george-enjoys-pizza-with-prince-william-at-cricket-game-photos.html>Prince George Enjoys Pizza With Prince William at Cricket Game: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./prince-george-enjoys-pizza-with-prince-william-at-cricket-game-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
