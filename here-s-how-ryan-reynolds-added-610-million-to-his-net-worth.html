Reynolds, whose marriage to Blake Lively has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gold on social media</a>, has been able to star in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel</a> flicks and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix Originals</a>, meaning he is someone that Hollywood clearly sees as a money maker. While not all of his films are bangers, Reynolds still has a history of success that few can match.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>In recent news, it was announced that Ryan Reynolds was part of a $610 million deal that will net him a staggering amount of cash. Celebrities know how to make money better than just about anyone else, but seeing numbers like this is still quite shocking for most people.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, how did Ryan Reynolds find himself negotiating this massive price tag? Let’s take a look and see how he pulled this off!</span></p><h2 id=reynolds-became-an-owner-of-aviation-gin>Reynolds Became An Owner Of Aviation Gin</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many celebrities aren’t afraid to attach their name to a brand for some cash, but few make serious investments and take the time to help grow the product. This was the route that Ryan Reynolds took after he bought a minority stake in the company back in 2018.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The company itself started <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2006</a>, meaning that this monster of a deal was something that they had been striving towards for nearly 15 years. There was a ton of work that went into making the company what it is today, and once Ryan Reynolds got involved, things hit another level.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Food And Wine</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Reynolds invested an unknown amount of money into the company. Furthermore, the site also reports that Reynolds is a minority owner in the company, meaning that he does not have full control over what goes on.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Nevertheless, getting Reynolds on board was a big deal for the company, as Reynolds has a massive celebrity name and was going to be able to advertise the brand out to his legions of followers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even though it took Aviation 12 years before it was able to land an investor like Reynolds, it would not take long for things to truly take off for the company. Reynolds, of course, did his part with his advertising and clever marketing tactics.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Ryan Reynolds And Scarlett Johansson Friends Or Enemies?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reynolds-markets-like-crazy>Reynolds Markets Like Crazy</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>With Ryan Reynolds on board, it was clear that Aviation was doing all the right things. This was the point where things really started to change for the company. Reynolds has a wide audience, and his ability to incorporate his wit into his social media posts really helped out in the long run.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Never one to miss an opportunity to make people laugh on social media, Reynolds was quite aggressive with his plugging of Aviation. This made sense, as he had quite a bit of money tied into the company. Over time, people would get to see how his marketing skills were, and the results are looking fantastic.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In one of the most clever marketing stunts pulled off by a celebrity, Ryan Reynolds utilized an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">out-of-office email prompt</a> that fans could get in contact with. Naturally, this made plenty of headlines, and it brought a lot of attention to the brand.</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Inc</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> reports that there were a number of personalized emails that the fans could receive from emailing the address, and it is said that the company received around 20,000 emails or so. This was brilliant by Reynolds, and the folks at Aviation must have known that they struck gold here.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now that Reynolds was taking Aviation to another level, it was time to find someone who was willing to buy the company and push it even further along.</span></p><p style=text-align:left><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Taylor Swift’s Friendship With Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds</a></span></p><h2 id=the-company-sells-for-610-million>The Company Sells For $610 Million</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aviation had finally reached a place where it was ready to be sold for a handsome sum of cash. What people didn’t realize, however, was just how high this price tag would go.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Deadline</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Aviation was able to be sold for $610 million to Diageo. This took the media by storm, as it showed just how impressive an investment in a gin company can be for the right people.</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Deadline</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> also reports that $335 million of that was an upfront payment. We don’t have an official number on how much Ryan Reynolds took home for his ownership stake, but we cannot imagine that this would be a small number.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some time ago, Diageo also dropped a potential $1 billion on Casamigos, which is partially owned by George Clooney, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Deadline</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Clearly, the company knows a thing or two about acquiring valuable brands, and Aviation is just the latest for Diageo.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ 10 Most Romantic Moments On Social Media</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>From </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Just Friends</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> to just $610 million, Ryan Reynolds seems to be making all the right moves in life. At this rate, we have to wonder what else that famed actor has up his sleeve.</span></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Ryan Reynolds Still Hate ‘Green Lantern’?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmqbKZnmK%2FpsXNqKOdq12WsaWxw2ZtamhdoratuMiopWasn2K1qr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-ryan-reynolds-added-610-million-to-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-how-ryan-reynolds-added-610-million-to-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-ryan-reynolds-added-610-million-to-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-how-ryan-reynolds-added-610-million-to-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-ryan-reynolds-added-610-million-to-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-ryan-reynolds-added-610-million-to-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-momoa-calls-stepdaughter-zoe-kravitz-s-husband-a-sexy-mf.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-momoa-calls-stepdaughter-zoe-kravitz-s-husband-a-sexy-mf.html>Jason Momoa Calls Stepdaughter Zoe Kravitzs Husband a Sexy' MF</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./billie-lourd-net-worth-how-much-is-billie-worth.html>Billie Lourd Net Worth How Much is Billie Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./billie-lourd-net-worth-how-much-is-billie-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
