His acting career is now more than three decades old, since he got started in the early '90s on the ABC sitcom The Wonder Years, and alongside the likes of Danny Glover and Willem Dafoe in the film Flight of the Intruder.All these years, credits and accolades later, Schwimmer is perhaps still best known for one role: <a href=#>the much adored Ross Geller on Friends</a>. In the famous NBC sitcom, Ross has a very unlucky streak when it comes to love. The character got married thrice on the show, with every single one of those ending in divorce.While his Friends character got such a bad rep with marriages - so much so that he earned the nickname, 'Ross the Divorce Force' - Schwimmer's actual love life is not that uncharacteristic of most people, not least in Hollywood. He has been married once, to British artist and writer ZoÃ« Buckman, although they called time on their nuptials in 2017.They have one baby together, a daughter called Cleo Buckman Schwimmer, and <a href=#>their relationship remains cordial to date</a>. Schwimmer has been rumored to have jumped back into the dating pool in recent years, but the actor is yet to officially confirm any new relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-schwimmer-admitted-to-crushing-on-his-friends-colleague-jennifer-aniston>David Schwimmer Admitted To Crushing On His 'Friends' Colleague, Jennifer Aniston</h2><p>David Schwimmer was most recently romantically linked with Jennifer Aniston, who portrayed Rachel Green on Friends, Ross Geller's biggest love interest on the show. The two actors were, however, categorical in their denial of these rumors, shortly after the <a href=#>special reunion episode of Friends</a> that was made available to stream on HBO Max in May 2021.</p><p>In the reunion episode, they admitted that they had both been crushing on each other in their early days on the show, although circumstances had conspired to ensure that they never ended up together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"At some point, we were both crushing hard on each other," Schwimmer had said. "But it was like two ships passing, because one of us was always in a relationship. And we never crossed that boundary. We respected that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About David Schwimmer's Daughter</a></span></p><p>In the weeks that followed, the grapevine started to swell with stories of a possible, new romantic involvement between them. Aniston has also not been in an official relationship since separating from her ex-boyfriend actor and director, Justin Theroux in 2017, which perhaps added momentum to the Schwimmer stories.</p><h2 id=who-else-has-david-schwimmer-been-linked-with>Who Else Has David Schwimmer Been Linked With?</h2><p>It was Jennifer Aniston who took the initiative to shut down any stories suggesting that he and Schwimmer might have finally found their way to each other's arms. "That was bizarre. I could not believe that, actually," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Entertainment Tonight</a> in September last year. "Like, really? That's my brother."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston did not take offense from the rumors, however, and admitted that she understood that they stemmed from the kind of connection that fans had with their characters. "I understand it, though," she reiterated. "It just shows you how hopeful people are for fantasies... for dreams to come true."</p><p>Before the Friends reunion opened up that particular can of worms, Schwimmer had also been linked with Katie Markowitz, a musician who has mostly worked as a background vocalist on stage and in studio for the likes of Cher, Bill Withers and Diana Ross. She is also the daughter of Richard Markowitz, who wrote the scores for various films and TV shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Jennifer Aniston And David Schwimmer's Relationship</a></span></p><p>According to reports, Schwimmer and Markowitz's paths first crossed at a bar, and they went on a few dates afterwards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-david-schwimmer-in-a-relationship-now>Is David Schwimmer In A Relationship Now?</h2><p>Markowitz was reportedly contacted by US Weekly in 2019 and asked to comment on the rumors that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had been out with Schwimmer on a number of occasions</a>. Then 29 years old, the singer denied the claims that she was dating him. Nothing concrete has evolved out of their alleged involvement in the months and years that have followed.</p><p>Since the Aniston and Markowitz rumors died down, Schwimmer has not been recently linked to anyone else. If he has been in any relationship within that period of time, he has done a very good job of keeping it hidden from public scrutiny - something which is very difficult to do when you are as famous as he is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, the 55-year-old actor appears to be fully invested in his work. Since 2020, he has been starring in a British sitcom titled Intelligence, alongside Ted Lasso star, Nick Mohammed.</p><p>He also joins Meryl Streep, Kit Harrington, Siena Miller and other stars in Apple TV+'s Extrapolations, an upcoming anthology drama series that focuses on the effects of climate change.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Did Nathan Fillion Ever Date His Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBusMCvoJ1lo5i1uLXMppyrZZSWwaq6xmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-david-schwimmer-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-david-schwimmer-dating.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-david-schwimmer-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-david-schwimmer-dating.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-david-schwimmer-dating.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-david-schwimmer-dating.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-olivia-rodrigo-left-high-school-musical-and-isn-t-coming-back.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-olivia-rodrigo-left-high-school-musical-and-isn-t-coming-back.html>Why Olivia Rodrigo Left High School Musical (And Isn't Coming Back)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-high-price-celebrities-pay-to-look-red-carpet-ready.html>The High Price Celebrities Pay To Look Red Carpet Ready</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-high-price-celebrities-pay-to-look-red-carpet-ready.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
