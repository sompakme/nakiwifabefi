In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its pilot received so many negative responses</a>, that many aspects were reworked after the initial viewings. When it finally made it to the small screen, the show which embraced the nerd culture wasn’t an instant hit.

Although it’s followed in the parent show’s footsteps and become CBS’ second most popular comedy, fans of the original series have been critical of the offshoot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They cite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many inconsistencies in the spinoff</a>, specifically around some of the storylines which had been set in the original series.

They’d also love to see a reboot featuring Howard, Bernadette, and their family. But producers are adamant there’ll be no sequels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show was created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, who were also executive producers. Interviewed after the show’s final wrap, Lorre spoke to TV Line. Asked about spinoffs, he answered that t<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he producers never seriously considered any character spinoffs</a>.</p><p>“Truthfully, the reason for a spinoff is economics, and that’s not the reason to do a show. You should do a show because you have something you really love, and you want to do it.

'Big Bang' was this magical thing that we captured, and then to recapture it with any version of them that wasn't the whole cast wasn't something we really wanted to do," he said.</p><p>Both Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady believe that they created a perfect ending to a great series, and that it would be hard to come back to reopen the story after the closure they achieved.</p><p>Speaking to Explore Entertainment in September 2022, Lorre said: “I don't think we left anything undone.
