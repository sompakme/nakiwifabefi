He played in high school, playing in the Area Code Games in both 2004 and 2005. He earned a scholarship from Arizona State University, where he played infield, and the team made it to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In 2008, after a year at Arizona State, he moved to the University of California, Irvine, where he played. He played baseball as a second baseman for the UC Irvine Anteaters. He also played in college summer leagues during this time.</p><p>Hoechlin opted for a baseball career, giving it priority over his obligations to act. It caused him to turn down auditions and meetings (including with legendary director Francis Ford Coppola) and decline Emmett Cullen’s role in Twilight movies. He pulled his hamstring during Hoechlin’s college junior year, restricting his ability to play and practice. As a result, he took part in further acting auditions, and finally, on his coach’s recommendation, made the decision to try full-time acting.</p><p>In the commercials, Hoechlin appeared as a baby. This led him to successfully audition at an acting school, and obtain an agent. His first appearance, at 11, was in Happy Haunting, a video from Disney Sing-Along Songs. At age 13 Hoechlin was chosen to play Michael Sullivan Jr. alongside Tom Hanks in Road to Perdition from 2000 auditionees.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tyler-hoechlin-age></span>Tyler Hoechlin Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Hoechlin was born on 11 September</strong> 1987 in Corona, California, United States. He celebrates his birthday on 11 September every year. His birth sign is Virgo.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tyler-hoechlin-height></span>Tyler Hoechlin Height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is a man of gigantic structure.

Throughout the 1980s through to the 1990s, the Olsen twins, Ashley Olsen, and Mary-Kate Olsen were prominent actors. What Tyler saw in Ashley is unknown which he did not see in her identical sister Mary-Kate.</p><p>Tyler describes his dream date as a Hawaiian trip to enjoy both the sun and the sea. In reality, it’s something he’s done before. He used to say Cosmopolitan. Rachele and Tyler are confirmed to have started dating sometime in 2010. The pair put together several public appearances, and they seemed happy and in love. In an interview, Tyler liked to talk about her. It looked as though Brooke and Tyler were happy together, but later news emerged that the pair broke up in 2012.</p><p>Rumors started circulating in 2004, saying Tyler had been gay. Once Tyler started dating Ashlee Simpson, he soon put an end to these rumors. The couple met 7th Heaven on the TV series stage and hit it off. It was, however, a short affair that only lasted a few months. Tyler was linked to Candice Accola, star of Vampire Diaries. The couple dated nearly a year, from 2004 to 2005. To date, Tyler has continued on American beauty, Brittany Snow.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tyler-hoechlin-net-worth></span>Tyler Hoechlin Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He has enjoyed a long career in the film industry spanning almost three decades.
