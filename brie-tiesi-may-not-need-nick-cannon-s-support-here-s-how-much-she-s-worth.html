<time>21 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Before being cast on <a href=#>Season Six of the drama-filled Selling Sunset</a>, Bre Tiesi had no desire to be on a reality show. She spent much of her life on the fringes of the spotlight. From being linked to Hulk Hogan's son, Nick Hogan during the early days of reality TV to <a href=#>being married to Johnny Manziel</a> until their divorce was finalized in November 2021, Tiesi has learned how to navigate life by her own narrative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Bre's aspirations of being a real estate agent and broker were still alive and well when she got pregnant, it was not buying and selling homes that would make Tiesi a household name. Instead, it was <strong><a href=#>Nick Cannon's</a></strong> announcement that he was expecting his eighth child and named Tiesi as <a href=#>another woman agreeing to have a baby with him</a>. Suddenly, Tiesi's name and face were everywhere. But instead of getting upset about the exposure, Tiesi capitalized on it. In doing so, Tiesi created a tidy fortune for herself.</p><h2 id=brie-tiesi-is-worth-around-4-million>Brie Tiesi Is Worth Around $4 Million</h2><p>Tiesi has not been one to sit on her laurels. Instead, she has always worked hard to live up to the standards of a specific (and expensive) lifestyle. As a result, she had a small fortune built before being known as Cannon's baby mama.</p><p>But after her son, Legendary Love was born, more opportunities came calling. Because of this, Tiesi may not need child support from Cannon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It is estimated that Tiesi is worth between $4 million and $6 million</a>. The wealth that Tiesi has accumulated has come from a variety of sources, none of which include a settlement from her divorce from Manzel. She left that relationship with what she came in with and no more.</p><p>During her teens, Tiesi modeled and tried her hand at acting. She also became a social media influencer to her over 900,000 followers and joined OnlyFans to provide exercise and health-related content. This is not where the big money came from, however. The majority of the money that Tiesi has come from real estate.</p><p>Tiesi has only been selling real estate for a short time, starting in 2022. But because the properties she does sell are luxury real estate, they are multi-million dollar sales. And after dedicating her efforts full-time to selling real estate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it paid off in spades</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I started taking [real estate] more seriously and tapping into my network, and that's when I started making some high-figure sales," Tiesi explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Have Any Of Nick Cannons Recent Scandals Impacted His Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Depending on how many homes Tiesi sold at Keller Williams before coming to The Oppenheim Group, she could have made quite a killing with a 3% commission. Estimates are that Tiesi had upwards of "$20 million in sales."</p><p>And now with receiving not only the same commission on Selling Sunset but being paid for appearing on the show, Tiesi's net worth is set to skyrocket.</p><h2 id=does-nick-cannon-pay-brie-tiesi-child-support>Does Nick Cannon Pay Brie Tiesi Child Support?</h2><p>Neither Cannon nor Tiesi's camps have stated one way or another whether the Drumline star pays child support for Legendary. But given that some of the <a href=#>five other women who have gotten pregnant</a> and had one or more of Cannon's 12 babies <a href=#>do receive child support,</a> it is possible that Tiesi does as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There has been speculation that <a href=#>Cannon pays out over $3 million annually for child support</a>. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannon refuted that figure, claiming it to be inaccurate</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nick-cannon-1.jpg><p>"I definitely spend a lot more than [$3 million] on my children annually,” Cannon explained. “I don’t plan to ever have to participate in the governmental system of [a] child."</p><p>The Wild 'N Out host went on to say, "My account is their account and it's a lot in there. So we are not going to run out."</p><p>While it does not appear that Cannon has a specific amount he is ordered to pay, it may be that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some women receive monthly payments</a> versus just asking for what they need. And those estimated monthly payments are between $40,000 and $60,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tiesi has said in interviews that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she does not want money from Cannon</a>, nor does she like being labeled a "gold digger." Both of these are signs that point to the fact that, financially, Tiesi is doing just fine.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Nick Cannon Actually Reveal How Much Time He Spends With His Kids?</a></span></p><p>"I've worked my a** off to be where I'm at," Tiesi explained. "I did this all by myself. And of course, my son is even more of a motivation. I want to give him everything from me. Not from my partner."</p><p>While Cannon may help out when asked, it is clear that Tiesi wants to essentially, financially, raise her son on her own.</p><h2 id=brie-tiesi-claims-nick-cannon-does-not-have-to-pay-child-support>Brie Tiesi Claims Nick Cannon Does Not Have To Pay Child Support</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bre-tiesi.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tiesi started a firestorm when she claimed on an episode of Selling Sunset that because of how many kids Cannon has, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is no longer required to pay child support</a>, and if he was ordered to, it would be substantially less because of the <a href=#>sheer number of children he has fathered on purpose</a>.</p><p>"The way it works is like, after 10, the court can basically say he can't afford to pay child support," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiesi explained</a>. "Or because he is who he is, they could say, 'We know you can afford X amount for each household.'"</p><p>This was vehemently denied by many, including Teisi's own lawyer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Selling Sunset Fans Are Siding With Bre Tiesi Amid Feud With Chelsea Lazkani Over Her Relationship With Nick Cannon</a></span></p><p>Whether Tiesi has been told this is why Cannon does not pay her a specific amount of child support monthly or if there just is not an order in place because Cannon pays for what all of his kids need, is unknown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With or without Cannon's money, Tiesi looks like she is doing well financially. And with being poised to continue to grow her wealth, she and Legendary will be very comfortable for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6GVYsGqsdKiZKydnKG2r7OMrKynq5Wpeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrie-tiesi-may-not-need-nick-cannon-s-support-here-s-how-much-she-s-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrie-tiesi-may-not-need-nick-cannon-s-support-here-s-how-much-she-s-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrie-tiesi-may-not-need-nick-cannon-s-support-here-s-how-much-she-s-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrie-tiesi-may-not-need-nick-cannon-s-support-here-s-how-much-she-s-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrie-tiesi-may-not-need-nick-cannon-s-support-here-s-how-much-she-s-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrie-tiesi-may-not-need-nick-cannon-s-support-here-s-how-much-she-s-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrities-that-time-travel-exploring-sci-fi-themes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrities-that-time-travel-exploring-sci-fi-themes.html>Celebrities That Time Travel Exploring Sci-Fi Themes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nas-takes-a-shot-at-doja-cat-on-new-single-ultra-black.html>Nas Takes A Shot At Doja Cat On New Single Ultra Black</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nas-takes-a-shot-at-doja-cat-on-new-single-ultra-black.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
