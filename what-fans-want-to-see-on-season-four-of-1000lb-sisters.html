The fourth season will premiere in January 2023 on TLC, finally giving viewers some answers on what's happened since the third season ended with Tammy Slaton finally agreeing to go back to rehab long term. But once she got there she stopped breathing and was put into a medically induced coma for a couple of weeks. There have been updates on Tammy, Amy, and Chris since the third season ended, leaving fans wishing to see certain aspects unfold in the upcoming season. Hereâ€™s what fans want to see happen on season four of 1000-lb Sisters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Incredible Way The 1000-lb Sisters Were A Success Before The First Episode</a></span></p><h2 id=tammy-39-s-weight-loss-journey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tammy's Weight Loss Journey</span></h2><p>Over three seasons, we've seen Tammy's few attempts at losing weight as well as her frequent <a href=#>rock bottoms</a>. But due to recent updates and Tammy's prolonged stay in a rehab facility, the future finally looks bright for the Slaton sister. Since Amy had her bariatric surgery a few years ago, viewers have become almost desperate to see Tammy lose weight and get the surgery as well. While Tammy is <a href=#>still in rehab</a> she's made major strides compared to how she acted in season three, already losing one hundred pounds in thirty days at the beginning of 2022. Fans can't wait to see how much she's lost and to be able to support her willingness to finally get help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tammy-39-s-new-love-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tammy's New Love Life</span></h2><p>Over three seasons we've seen Tammy's many tumultuous relationships with men like the BBW King who wanted her to keep on her weight, but news recently broke about Tammy's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new relationship</a> she formed in rehab. Forming a bond through their weight loss journeys, Tammy fell in love with Caleb Willingham and already has the support of her friends and family. Viewers were stunned when it was recently revealed that Caleb proposed to Tammy in the rehab parking lot and that they then got married in November, with sister Amy by her side. While the wedding might not be shown in the upcoming season, we can't wait to see how their relationship unfolded - including the new home they share outside of rehab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-39-s-kids><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Amy's Kids</span></h2><p>Season three left a second pregnancy up in the air for Amy Slaton, but if you visit her social media you can see that she's already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">given birth to another boy</a> named Glenn back in July 2022. After Amy and her husband Michael welcomed their first son Gage back in 2020 after Amy's weight loss surgery and fulfilling Amy's lifelong dream of becoming a mother, Amy continued to ignore her doctor's warnings about having children. While fans are happy Amy's dream has come true, they are still concerned about her health. And while Amy has claimed she will be taking a backseat in the upcoming season, fans would like to see the birth of their second son and his interactions with Gage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-39-s-continued-weight-loss><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Amy's Continued Weight Loss</span></h2><p>After having her first son Gage in 2020, many fans were disappointed to see Amy start to revert to her old habits before her weight loss journey and surgery. She started to dismiss her diet and claim she was eating for two whenever she was called out for eating something unhealthy. After coming so far, her family and viewers were upset to see her take away focus on her health after becoming a mother. Seeing Amy continue on her weight loss journey and support her sister as she did back in season one would help alleviate some concerns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fan-favorite-chris><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Fan Favorite Chris</span></h2><p>In season two, the Slaton sisters' brother Chris Combs was introduced and fans instantly adored him and his tough love approach to his sisters, in particular Tammy. He decided that he wanted to help push Tammy to lose weight by joining her on her weight-loss journey. Fans clamored him on and were excited to see him committed to <a href=#>his journey</a>, eventually getting surgery. Instantly becoming a fan favorite of the show, viewers can't wait to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how far he's come</a> since the end of Season 3.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>TLC Has A History Of Making Shows That Are Equally Controversial As They Are Bizarre</a></span></p><h2 id=more-of-the-family><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>More Of The Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the show went on, fans got to see more of the Slaton family, including their mother and other siblings. One of the standouts is sister Amanda Halterman, who isn't afraid to call out Amy and Tammy on their attitude and mistakes, knowing how they feel after undergoing weight loss surgery years beforehand. We'd love to see more of the Slaton siblings and see their mother be a champion for Tammy, even with her tough love attitude, after witnessing a few wholesome moments in season three. Maybe we'll even get to see some new members of the family on screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Amy and Tammy Slaton, The '1000-Lb. Sisters,' True Life Details, Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=wholesome-moments><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Wholesome Moments</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's been a lot of drama on 1000-lb Sisters, especially with Tammy and her refusal in the past to get help or let anyone tell her what to do. Season three saw many sibling arguments break out and a downward spiral for Tammy, making us want to see more wholesome and happy moments for not only the Slaton sisters but the entire family as Tammy finally gets the help she needs as well as the new chapter in her life with her husband. The jokes and smiles between the two sisters are what made season one and the show a success in the first place.</p><h2 id=exiting-rehab><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Exiting Rehab</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it may still be too soon for Tammy to leave behind her rehab facility, an update at least as to when she will be leaving would be a nice note to leave season four on in contrast to the devastating news at the end of Season 3. Viewers want to see Tammy stay in the facility as long as she needs to, but getting to see her new life outside of it with her husband and their new home is what we want to eventually see. Seeing Tammy, her new husband, and the rest of the Slaton siblings going to new places, even overseas, is also something fans are hoping for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiutJmrpqmpGLBsHnSnpxmp55iwKat0qilZp6fqr9uu8VmaGloYKGvbr%2FIrKueqqNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-fans-want-to-see-on-season-four-of-1000lb-sisters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-fans-want-to-see-on-season-four-of-1000lb-sisters.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-fans-want-to-see-on-season-four-of-1000lb-sisters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-fans-want-to-see-on-season-four-of-1000lb-sisters.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-fans-want-to-see-on-season-four-of-1000lb-sisters.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-fans-want-to-see-on-season-four-of-1000lb-sisters.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bitter-frenemies-the-financial-meltdown-between-ethan-klein-trish-paytas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bitter-frenemies-the-financial-meltdown-between-ethan-klein-trish-paytas.html>Bitter Frenemies: The Financial Meltdown Between Ethan Klein &amp;amp; Trish Paytas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-sylvester-stallone-s-extremely-complicated-relationship-with-his-parents.html>The Truth About Sylvester Stallone's Extremely Complicated Relationship With His Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-truth-about-sylvester-stallone-s-extremely-complicated-relationship-with-his-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
