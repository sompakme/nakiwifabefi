class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It took eight seasons for Dr. Hank R. Lawson to find his long-overdue happy ending on&nbsp;Royal Pains, but, as actor Mark Feuerstein&nbsp;promised, the USA series has indeed come to a satisfying conclusion. Although the eighth and final&nbsp;season presented Hank warring with the idea of laying down permanent roots in the Hamptons and carrying on HankMed while the rest of the team scattered off to their various new adventures (with Evan devoting his full attention to his administrative job at Hamptons Heritage Hospital and Divya moving away to Baltimore to attend medical school at Johns Hopkins), he realized such a&nbsp;choice wouldn’t provide the sense of fulfillment he was really after.</p><p>So, instead, he followed the signs that were pointing him to Sierra Leone, where his former flame Jill had established a blissful new life as head of a medical clinic, and, ultimately, he decided to join her and give their relationship a stronger second effort —&nbsp;uninterrupted, as he and the episode coined it.&nbsp; He certainly felt the emotion of the moment when he finally said goodbye to his long-time screen counterpart. He told EW that the last day of filming —&nbsp;which was actually shooting a scene from&nbsp;the penultimate episode, featuring himself and&nbsp;co-star Paolo Costanzo —&nbsp;was marked with an extremely long, brotherly hug between the pair. The last shot of the series, he explained, “was the moment when Eddie [played by Henry Winkler] was trying to get rid of Hank so that he could have a moment of bonding with Evan, but he wasn’t successful because Evan was onto him and he left with me.”</p><p>“The scene ended and there was this moment where, in the video village outside of the set, [co-creators]&nbsp;Michael [Rauch]&nbsp;and Andrew [Lenchewski]&nbsp;were hugging, and on-set on the monitor next to them were Paolo and I hugging. And people around could just see how much love there was in the room, and it’s between these two pairs of the creators – the producers – and me and Paolo. And because they were writers, they ended after a minute, and Paolo and I kept hugging. It was a very close family.” The show has long boasted a strong familial vibe between the characters, whether they were biologically related or not, and, in Feuerstein’s mind, “art absolutely did imitate life” on that note.</p><p>“From the get-go, we were all pretty grateful to be making this show, but I don’t think we could have known just how close we all would have gotten over the course of eight years together,” he said. “It’s twice as long as one spends in college, and we grew together. I mean, people had children, people got married, people lost family members. We had sicknesses. But we had so many great moments that we all shared as individuals, and then we got to come together and make this show that was filmed with so much heart and so much love that there was really no line between the love on-screen and the love off. Sure, there were moments, there were disagreements. Sure, there were even periods of time when peop</p><p>And even though the book is now officially closed on HankMed&nbsp;and Dr. Lawson’s practice in the Hamptons is to be strictly limited to his summer stays at his brother’s estate (thanks Boris!), Feuerstein feels certain everyone who was involved in the company will remain a&nbsp;tight-knit unit for decades to come, long after that treat of a&nbsp;three-year-ahead epilogue sequence.&nbsp; “I think for characters like Evan and Hank…&nbsp;that they finally settle into a life where they’re not searching as much, but settling in, deepening their ties, deepening their connections to the Hamptons and to the patients, [and] that HankMed will build an even bigger family and will all be a great support for each other.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mark-feuerstein-twitter></span><span>Mark Feuerstein Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by markfeuerstein</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mark-feuerstein-instagram></span><span>Mark Feuerstein Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mark-feuerstein-interview></span><span>Mark Feuerstein Interview</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>When you first started the show up to now, how does your character still surprise you?</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Feuerstein</strong>: That is a great question and I would expect nothing less from the Daily Actor.&nbsp; That’s actually, Lance, the challenge of what we do as a whole, is to surprise yourself and to allow a character who’s already had stories told about him and similar words put in his mouth over the course of 30 episodes to remain fresh and new.</p><p>The writers do most of that work.&nbsp; They are so good at changing the game and keeping it fresh, keeping it interesting.&nbsp; I can’t tell you how grateful I am to have a writing staff that doesn’t phone it in, that hasn’t gotten bored with it.&nbsp; I can only expect in season three they’re going to up the stakes and up the game even more for our characters.</p><p>But, as the actor playing that character, you just try to find substitutions in your own life and the truth is your own life is never empty of high stake situations from me, being the father of three children and having a wife who I love very much and parents who I love to imagine scenarios where you might, in the case of our father, Eddie R. Lawson, might lose your father.&nbsp; Or, in the case of your brother might do damage that will be irreparable.</p><p>So, it’s all about getting creative in your own mind with the work of imagining scenarios that evoke emotions that help tell the story because often enough if we rely just on the words we’re okay because the words do it so often.&nbsp; But in situations where you’re just not feeling it, you have to find a way to, as you said, surprise yourself.</p><p><strong>What’s your advice to actors?</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Feuerstein</strong>: This is a line that I sometimes feel weird because it sounds so crass to say it, but it was something so bold of this producer who really didn’t want to help me said to me when I met with her to see about anything that she could do, and it was that there’s no one in the Mark Feuerstein business more than Mark Feuerstein.</p><p>And that is sort of a, I mean, I guess there’s something about that because you have to believe that if you have a manager and an agent and people who write for you and are rooting for you in your corner, they’re going to help you along the way, but I think the line is more about taking responsibility because if you do leave it to other people to make those phone calls on your behalf, if you don’t take the risk of reaching out.</p><p>I mean, when I got Royal Pains, I don’t want to bore you with a long story, but I’ll keep it short.&nbsp; Basically it was a moment in my career where I was doing a show called Masters of Horror, which wasn’t my best work, let’s put it that way and I can’t say I loved that.&nbsp; It was fine, but I didn’t love the episode I did.&nbsp; And it was just a moment in time where my wife was about to have a baby, I wanted to work, earn a little money.</p><p>And the producer of that was a guy named Adam Goldworm who went to USC with a guy names Andrew Lenchewski, who I had met years earlier because his dad took out my wisdom teeth and told me I should meet with him.&nbsp; So, a year after shooting Masters of Horror I’m having lunch with&nbsp; Adam Goldworm, this producer who I just kind of became friends with, whether you call it networking or not, he was a new friend and he told me, by the way, Andrew is shooting this new pilot for USA.&nbsp; Isn’t that great?</p><p>And I said, yeah, that’s great.&nbsp; Give me your cell phone, I want to congratulate him.&nbsp; And I called Andrew right up and I said, “Andrew, first of all, I want to congratulate you on the fact that you’re making a pilot for USA and I heard it’s about a doctor to the rich and the not so rich in the Hamptons, so second, I want to congratulate you on the fact that I’m going to be starring in it.”</p><p>And it was pretty bold, but a month later, after jumping through a lot of hoops for Bonnie Hammer, the head of many networks now at NBC Universal, I was.&nbsp; And it’s the greatest story of my career to date.</p><p><strong>What is it that made you decide to be an actor?&nbsp; You said your family were lawyers and did that business.&nbsp; What was it about acting that made you decide to go your own way?</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Feuerstein</strong>: My story is kind of unique, like everyone I guess thinks their own story is, and in high school if you had asked me what I was going to be I was going to be a lawyer like my dad and my other uncles, some of whom went to Harvard Law School and made a great living as lawyers in Manhattan.</p><p>I had been very involved in all the extracurricular activities that would get you into a good college; student politics, I was captain of football and wrestling teams.&nbsp; I did well enough in school to get into a good school, Princeton.&nbsp; And then I got there and I was doing all these extracurricular activities again, thinking that when you’re apply to Harvard Law School they care if you were able to organize a dance for the class of ’93, which, of course, they don’t give a shit about.</p><p>So, at one point in my freshman year at Princeton I scrapped everything.&nbsp; I said, what am I doing?&nbsp; I don’t genuinely care about a lot of this and I had fun in modern drama class in 11th grade reading scenes from “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” and “A Streetcar Named Desire” and Chekov plays, so I auditioned for this play on a whim.</p><p>I was on my way to football practice on the lightweight football team and I didn’t get the first part I auditioned for, but I did get the next part, a play by Lyle Kessler, a Philadelphia playwright, called “Orphans” and it was actually, I mean the crazy synergy of life, the luck, that I was acting with a guy names Josh Klausner, who ended up writing the story for the movie Date Night and is a very talented writer and director now.</p><p>And my next director was Eugene Jarecki, brother of Andrew Jarecki, who did Capturing the Freidmans and Eugene, who he himself directed Why We Fight and a bunch of fascinating documentaries himself, and I just happened into the group of people who I thought were maybe the coolest on the planet and wanted to be a little more like them and the rush of being on stage and making people laugh and making people cry and something about my psychosis as a second child, younger sibling, wanting attention combined and, bam, an actor is born.</p><p><strong>How did working with Henry Winkler bring out the best in you as an actor, in terms of something unexpected?</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Feuerstein</strong>: Henry is always present; he’s always listening as an actor.&nbsp; He only wants for you to do the best work you can do, meaning he’s concerned not only for himself, and he’s always great, but also for his scene partner, so there’s this moment that I love from season two in one of his first episodes; I think it was like the first episode he shot.&nbsp; We’re standing on the deck of Ms. Newport’s house at a party she’s throwing for her daughter.&nbsp; It’s like the second or third time I’ve seen our dad out there and he just shows up at this party and I’m very resentful and I’m very dismissive of him.</p><p>The line in the script was, “I hope that soon you’ll be able to trust me.”&nbsp; My reaction was something like, yeah, whatever, goodbye.&nbsp; But when the camera was on me and not on him, he changed the line and he said, “Hank, I love you.”&nbsp; Instead of being able to just dismiss it, it got this reaction out of me that was vulnerable, unexpected and much more interesting than what had been evoked just by the words on the page, because he just gave a much higher stakes feed into my line and that’s the kind of actor he is.</p><p><strong>How did you prepare for your role as a doctor on the show?</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Feuerstein</strong>: I followed doctors around, whoever would allow me to.&nbsp; I met with concierge doctors.&nbsp; I sat in on a brain surgery approaching the time of shooting, staring through a hole in somebody’s head and looking into the center of who they are.</p><p>I talked to concierge doctors about who their clients are.&nbsp; I think they’re generally slightly older and slightly less attractive than the ones you see on Royal Pains, but I got a sense for what niche this concierge medicine thing has filled in our marketplace.&nbsp; And we have on staff on the show a doctor named Irving Danish.&nbsp; He’s an emergency surgeon in Marblehead, Massachusetts.&nbsp; And not only is he the onset doctor who is helping to make sure that everything we’re performing is accurate.&nbsp; He’s also the doctor who is giving the writers their ideas for the emergency situations that come up on the show, so there’s a great synergy that happens because he’s the one who thought of these, who researched them and who offered them up to be written.</p><p>So, right there on set we have the best source ever.&nbsp; He’s also the best guy ever because if you’re suffering from something actual on set, whether it’s me getting vertigo from diving into a pool ten times in a row or Paulo having headache, he’s right there.&nbsp; So, there are actual medical episodes that he’s taking care of while also giving us the brilliant fake ones.</p><p><strong>What would you say you and your character Hank have in common?</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Feuerstein</strong>: That’s a great question.&nbsp; I think wish more than is actually true.&nbsp; But I would say the aspiration of Hank, the hope that he is living the best life he can for who he is; I share that with Hank.&nbsp; Hank is trying to do the most good for the most people where he can and given what happened to him back in Brooklyn, he has to make do with a new situation out in Long Island and as an actor, you’re always trying to find the best opportunities.</p><p>I certainly have, just like Hank, my own skeletons in the closet, as my manager would say, everything from a bad TV show here and there to a bad audition here and there.&nbsp; So the name of the show this Thursday night is “Mulligan,” which means, in golf terms, a do-over.&nbsp; And just like my character gets a do-over in Long Island, just like Henry Winkler’s character gets a do-over I feel that as an actor I’ve been given a do-over with Royal Pains to do it right.</p><p><strong>What are the challenges you face in portraying Hank?</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Feuerstein</strong>: &nbsp;Nah, it’s nothin’, I phone it in.&nbsp; No, it’s a great role that there are many challenges.&nbsp; There are challenges in terms of the high stakes emotion that is called upon Hank every week, whether it’s for a patient or his brother or his father or Divya or Jill.&nbsp; I love the role because I get to be romantic, dramatic, comedic and this medical MacGyver.&nbsp; So, it’s thrilling for all those reasons.</p><p>But there are moments, in addition to just the acting of it and the emotional challenges of just acting really beautifully written scenes, the medical terminology; I’m thinking of things like glossopharyngeal nerve, I’m thinking of familial vasovagal syncope, all the various conditions and ailments that I have to pronounce correctly and have to do it under duress and the pressure of an emergency medical situation.&nbsp; That’s challenging in and of itself.</p><p>But all the challenges that come with this role are never challenges like taking a history test in high school.&nbsp; They’re the challenges you dream of having.&nbsp; When I’m walking Carl Schurz park, where I walk on the upper East Side learning my lines for hours on end, just trying to by osmosis shove them into my brain for the time they need to be there, I’m never not aware how lucky I am that I get this challenge every week to learn these beautiful lines, to tell these beautiful stories, as I play this dream role for an actor.</p><strong>Source:&nbsp;www.dailyactor.com</strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRp7hussSunKurpJq2r3nBoqagqpGltbp5wKCcZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2aZk6m8s3nMqK2inaNiwW7CjKyfqK%2BjYriqsNJmp6WZo6m2pHnSrqmgnaKuerO72JqjZqiRnru0eZFo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmark-feuerstein-biography-age-net-worth-actor-movies-t-v-shows-kids-plastic-surgery-royal-pa.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./matthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./matthew-broderick-isn-t-the-only-ferris-bueller-s-day-off-cast-member-to-date-an-on-screen-relative.html>Matthew Broderick Isn't The Only Ferris Bueller's Day Off Cast Member To Date An On-Screen Relative</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./justin-and-hailey-bieber-have-been-focusing-on-improving-relationship-during-her-pregnancy.html>Justin And Hailey Bieber Have Been Focusing on Improving Relationship During Her Pregnancy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./justin-and-hailey-bieber-have-been-focusing-on-improving-relationship-during-her-pregnancy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
