One of which was her appearance on 2 Broke Girls starring Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's interesting is that the show is known for its Kardashian-Jenner slander. A fan wrote on the KUWTK subreddit: "Not surprised since Whitney Cummings created the show (and wrote it?) but also, even as recently as 2011 it was a different time then and the K-Js weren't regarded as they are now."</p><p>Well, it might change if <a href=#>Behrs' dream reboot</a> pushes through. "Kat and I always talk about how we never got to say goodbye," said the actress.</p><p>"They sort of canceled us," she continued. "Nobody was expecting it, including the writers, so we never got to see what happened to the girls, which was kind of a bummer."</p><p>But given Kardashian's new cred — being cast in <a href=#>Ryan Murphy's American Horror Story</a> — she might opt to skip the diner/dessert bar this time...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen Is Unaffected After Ex, Tom Brady Addresses Kim Kardashian Dating Rumors</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-kim-kardashian-39-s-role-in-american-horror-story-season-12>What Is Kim Kardashian's Role In American Horror Story Season 12?</h2><p>People weren't happy about Kardashian's involvement in the upcoming AHS season. Patti LuPone, an actress from the show even said in an episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen: "Excuse me, Kim. What are you doing with your life? Don't get on the stage."</p><h2><img alt="Kim Kardashian" height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-white-dress.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p>But speaking to Variety at the Met Gala, the billionaire said that she was "so excited for the experience" despite the backlash. "It's really fun to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new and grow," she told the outlet.</p><p>Murphy previously told The Hollywood Reporter that showrunner, Halley Feiffer wrote Kardashian's part "especially for" her, adding that "Kim is among the biggest and brightest television stars in the world and we are thrilled to welcome her to the AHS family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kardashians star will be acting alongside Emma Roberts who is also "excited about collaborating with this true force in the culture." Don't worry, the mother of four is "of course" taking acting lessons as she "like[s] to challenge" herself.</p><p>Matt Czuchry, Cara Delevingne, Annabelle Dexter-Jones, MJ Rodriguez and Odessa A'zion are also set to join her in the upcoming season called Delicate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian's Description Of "Working Hard" Did Not Impress Anyone</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-kim-kardashian-agree-to-a-cameo-on-2-broke-girls>Why Did Kim Kardashian Agree To A Cameo On 2 Broke Girls?</h2><p>Despite the unflattering remarks about her on the show, Kardashian admitted to being a fan of 2 Broke Girls. "I've done acting a little bit, but it's not typically what I do," she told Entertainment Tonight while filming her cameo. "It's always fun to just get out and do something new and fun. I'm a fan of the show. I think it's super cute."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-white-dress.jpg><p>Unfortunately, The New York Post didn't seem impressed with her performance. In a sarcastic review of her line, "I just wanted to say sorry that we didn’t film here the other day," the publication wrote: "Uh oh, things have really taken a hard left turn."</p><p>"The word 'sorry' does not seem to be a word that Kim is familiar with," they continued. "It rolls off her tongue with all the grace of German profanity." Their verdict was that "Kim Kardashian West is more than qualified to play herself in sixty second segments for years to come."</p><p>Many viewers seemed to agree, with one writing on Reddit: "I hate how the script had them fawning over her like she’s the greatest thing ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Kim Kardashian Try To Bribe The Mayor Of L.A.?

"I didn't know what to expect because she's so famous," she recalled of that time on The Ellen Show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kim-kardashian.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was very nervous because I've seen so many episodes [of Keeping Up with the Kardashians], and she was very sweet. She was very nice," Dennings added, noting that Kardashian's "ass is amazing! I am feminism, girl power, but I was just so in love with her ass. I just spit talking about it - that's how passionate I feel!''</p><p>She kept raving about the entrepreneur's assets, saying "She's gorgeous. It's just amazing. I've never seen an ass like that in my life." She also shared that it preoccupied her mind the whole time they were shooting the episode.</p><p>"There's an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians - an oldie, a vintage one, before she and Kanye got married," she told <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong>, "and she was doing her music video and Kanye was there and he was like, 'I have never seen an ass like that.'
