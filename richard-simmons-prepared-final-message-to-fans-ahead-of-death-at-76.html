He had many ideas and would work ahead … going back to each one making changes until he had it just like he wanted before posting,” his staff wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook</a> on Saturday, July 21. “As you know, on the weekends, he would just share a photo with a caption.&nbsp; He always chose his photos and wrote his captions for the upcoming weekend by Friday.”</p><p class=p1>According to Simmons’ team members, they thought fans would “want to see” the upload the fitness icon planned to share on July 14.</p><p class=p1>For his planned post last Sunday, Simmons intended to share a portrait of himself wearing an astronaut uniform in front of a photoshopped intergalactic backdrop.</p><p class=p1>“Let me fly you to the moon so we can gaze among the stars,” he intended to write, quoting the <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong> song. The message was signed, “Love, Richard.”</p><p class=p1>Simmons did not get to post the upload as anticipated as he <a href=#>died one day earlier on July 13</a>. According to his reps at the time, Simmons was found dead inside his Los Angeles house that morning.</p><p class=p1>A cause of death has not been confirmed and<a href=#> an investigation is ongoing</a>. Local law enforcement authorities, however, do not believe that foul play was involved.</p><p class=p1>Simmons died shortly after he turned 76, a milestone he marked on social media.</p><p class=p1>“So many of you have sent me birthday wishes on my Facebook and other platforms,” he wrote on Facebook at the time. “I really appreciate that. I don’t know when your birthday is but I wish you a happy and healthy birthday!”</p><p class=p1>Prior to his death, the reclusive star had been <a href=#>diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma</a>.</p><p class=p1>“There was this strange-looking bump under my right eye. I had a tube of neosporin which I would put on in the morning and the evening … it was still there. It was time to call my dermatologist,” he recalled in a March social media message. “I sat in his chair and he looked at it through a magnifying mirror. He told me he would have to scrape it and put it under the microscope. Now I am getting a little bit nervous.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Simmons’ dermatologist then confirmed the fitness trainer’s diagnosis.</p><p class=p1>“I asked him what kind of cancer and he said Basal Cell Carcinoma. I told him to stop calling me dirty names. He laughed,” Simmons joked. “‘You have to go to a cancer doctor right away. But now that you are here I suggest you put some Botox in your forehead lines and your smile lines and let’s pump up those cheeks of yours.’ I patted him on his hand and said, ‘Not today doctor.’”</p><p class=p1>Simmons eventually underwent multiple procedures to remove the cancerous tissue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroZOdrrOwjKygpqWfo8BuvNGep5qqlZl6p7XNmqNmpZWowKKzxGarqGWWlru0ecChnJqcXaSzbrDEmquhZZGpeniCjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichard-simmons-prepared-final-message-to-fans-ahead-of-death-at-76.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frichard-simmons-prepared-final-message-to-fans-ahead-of-death-at-76.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frichard-simmons-prepared-final-message-to-fans-ahead-of-death-at-76.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frichard-simmons-prepared-final-message-to-fans-ahead-of-death-at-76.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichard-simmons-prepared-final-message-to-fans-ahead-of-death-at-76.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichard-simmons-prepared-final-message-to-fans-ahead-of-death-at-76.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-jamie-oliver-story-from-an-average-student-to-a-world-renowned-chef.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-jamie-oliver-story-from-an-average-student-to-a-world-renowned-chef.html>The Jamie Oliver Story: From An Average Student To A World Renowned Chef</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rich-boccini-wrestlezone.html>Rich Boccini - Wrestlezone</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rich-boccini-wrestlezone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
