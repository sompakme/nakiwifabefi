One of them is the leading lady Nina Dobrev as teen orphan Elena Gilbert who stole the hearts of the aged-vampire Salvatore brothers. Dobrev took on a dual role with the introduction of her doppelganger, Katherine Pierce. So while she played the main hero of the show quite convincingly, she also took on the villain of the show with ease. Her doppelganger duty went further with her also portraying Amara and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tatia on the show's spinoff series The Originals.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lili-reinhart---look-both-ways><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lili Reinhart - Look Both Ways</span></h2><p>The actress is living a fulfilling life <a href=#>outside her breakout role as Betty Cooper in CW's Riverdale</a>.

This biopic directed by Guy Richie follows the infamous Kray brothers as they attempt to transform '60s London into "the Las Vegas of Europe." Despite being twins, the Kray brothers are far from being the same, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardy captures this contrast remarkably.</a> Reggie was the charming and calm-headed leader of the pack, while Ronnie was the unstable and irrational one.</p><h2 id=armie-hammer---the-social-network><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Armie Hammer - The Social Network</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">embroiled in a sexual misconduct and cannibalism</a> scandal, it is undeniable that the actor has served pretty impressive onscreen moments in the past.
