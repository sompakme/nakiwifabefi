It was supposed to be just another hosting gig for comedian actor, Chris Rock, but the events that transpired put him at the center of yet another awards controversy. This time, however, wasn’t just a matter of the wrong winner being announced on stage. Instead, after making a comment about Jada Pinkett-Smith and a possible G.I. Jane 2, he was physically assaulted by fellow actor Will Smith.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as being a crowning moment for the best stars in film, the event is now remembered for the infamous “<a href=#>Will Smith slap” on comedian Chris Rock.</a> Will slapped the host after his remark to Jada – a joke that he didn’t find particularly funny. However, recently, the actor has apologized to Chris via video message, thanks to his wife’s constant pressure.</p><h2 id=will-smith-apologized-to-chris-rock>Will Smith Apologized To Chris Rock</h2><p>Will Smith had finally apologized to Chris Rock for slapping him onstage at the Oscars after the comedian made an unscripted remark about the actor’s wife Jada, seemingly unaware of her journey with alopecia and hair loss.</p><p>In the online post, he admitted, “Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And yet again, <a href=#>Will apologized to Chris via video</a> through his YouTube channel. At the start of video, a message on screen reads, “It’s been a minute…Over the last few months, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and personal work. You asked a lot of fair questions that I wanted to take the time to answer.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Academy CEO Bill Kramer Addressed The Will Smith Scandal And Oscars’ Future</a></span></p><p>The actor then answered questions that came up on screen. He said he didn’t apologize to Chris in his acceptance speech because was “fogged out” and his memories remain unclear.</p><p>He explained, “I’ve reached out to Chris, and the message that came back is that he’s not ready to talk, and when he is, he will reach out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added, “So I will say to you, Chris, I apologize to you. My behavior was unacceptable, and I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk.”</p><p>Not only did Will express regret to what he did to the comedian, but he also sent his apology to Chris’ family. “I saw an interview that his mother did. That’s one of the things about that moment I didn’t realize, I wasn’t thinking, but how many people got hurt in that moment,” he explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Jada Pinkett Rolling Her Eyes Provoke Will Smith’s Oscar Slap?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then continued, “So I want to apologize to Chris’ mother; I want to apologize to Chris’ family, specifically Tony Rock. We had a great relationship. Tony Rock was my man. This is probably irreparable.”</p><p>Later in the video, Will said, “I’m not gonna try to unpack all of that right now, but I can say to you, there was no part of me that thought that was the right way to behave in that moment.”</p><p>With the apologies made by Will, reflecting on his behavior as he addressed the Academy, Chris Rock and his family, many wonder if Jada Pinkett Smith was behind it.</p><p>An insider of Us Weekly even revealed that the actor never really wanted to apologize publicly but had to give in because of his wife.</p><h2 id=did-jade-push-will-smith-to-publicly-apologize>Did Jade Push Will Smith To Publicly Apologize?</h2><p>With the apologies made by Will, reflecting on his behavior as he addressed the Academy, Chris Rock and his family, many wonder if Jada Pinkett Smith was behind it. An insider of Us Weekly even revealed that the actor never really wanted to apologize publicly but had to give in because of his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The insider told the publication that Jada was the one who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">convinced Will to publicly apologize</a> to his fellow actor for striking him on live television at the 94th annual Academy Awards in March 2022.</p><p>“Jada has also been pushing Will to apologize because it has become this really dark cloud over her Red Table Talk series,” the source disclosed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside The 24-Year-Long Relationship Of Will Smith And Jada Pinkett-Smith</a></span></p><p>It was also revealed that Will has been “in hell” since the incident and wanted to find a way to “move forward” without talking about the slap again. The insider also said, “His team had hoped that the controversy would die down, but it just hasn’t. It would be impossible for him to move forward successfully unless he [addressed the slap].”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The incident was indeed a huge scandal for the Oscars, although <a href=#>some actually thought it was good for their publicity</a>. On the one hand, there are those who believe that Will Smith was justified for his action after Chris made a joke about Jada’s alopecia-induced balding. But majority agree that it was out of line.</p><p>Thank goodness, the actor apologized for what he’s done, even if he was supposedly forced by his wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn66lrYypoKejlanBbr%2FMoquhZZakv6SxjLCgpaRdqLqqwMdmmKmnnKS0qsbEZpqhqpmoerO7wqRm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-jada-pinkett-smith-force-will-smith-to-apologize-to-chris-rock.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-jada-pinkett-smith-force-will-smith-to-apologize-to-chris-rock.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-jada-pinkett-smith-force-will-smith-to-apologize-to-chris-rock.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-jada-pinkett-smith-force-will-smith-to-apologize-to-chris-rock.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-jada-pinkett-smith-force-will-smith-to-apologize-to-chris-rock.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-jada-pinkett-smith-force-will-smith-to-apologize-to-chris-rock.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./evan-rachel-wood-news-us-weekly.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./evan-rachel-wood-news-us-weekly.html>Evan Rachel Wood News - Us Weekly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./barbara-novick-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Barbara Novick Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./barbara-novick-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
