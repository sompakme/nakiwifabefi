While past contestant,&nbsp;Tyler Cameron, shared his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crush on 48-year-old Jennifer Garner</a> on social media, there’s no chance she’ll be on the show.</p><p>While age should not be a factor in finding love, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crawley is almost 40</a>, and her age has been a topic of discussion among fans. Some think she’s too old for this reality show, while others embrace the change, especially since many prior contestants have been so young, and perhaps not really ready for marriage.</p><p>There are two sides to every coin, and there are pros and cons to being 39 on this show. While Crawley is confident in her choice to participate, she must realize the potential for problems, even if there are plenty of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">positive aspects, too</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=plus-she-knows-what-kind-of-guy-she-s-looking-for><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Plus: She Knows What Kind Of Guy She’s Looking For</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-1.jpg><p>Once a person is nearly 40, they have a good idea of what type of person they are seeking as a mate. Crawley has surely dated many men already, and she was also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a past contestant</a> on The Bachelor. At this stage, Crawley knows what she’s looking for, so she can weed out the men who aren’t the right match. This will help her find “the one” without worrying that she's let the wrong guys go.</p><h2 id=plus-she-s-well-past-playing-games><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Plus: She’s Well Past Playing Games</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 39, Crawley isn’t interested in playing games or beating around the bush. She’s ready for love and will be direct and forthcoming with the men in the mansion. If she’s going to find her match, she needs to be straightforward and honest, and she can’t compromise her chances of finding her husband by being silly or unnaturally sweet.</p><p>Now’s the time for Crawley to put it all out there and see which men are open to all she has to offer.</p><h2 id=plus-she-can-teach-the-guys-a-thing-or-two><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Plus: She Can Teach The Guys A Thing Or Two</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-3.jpg><p>Some of the men in the mansion will be younger than Crawley. As the more “mature” partner, she can guide them with her experience and wisdom. She may have more to learn in many areas, but her age has afforded her a number of opportunities to evolve and become educated. The men in the group will appreciate her stories and solutions, and will surely find her to be interesting and insightful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=plus-she-s-a-fresh-change-for-the-show><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Plus: She’s A Fresh Change For The Show</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-4.jpg><p>Seeing an “older” woman as the main face of the franchise is long overdue. Women in their 20s and early 30s obviously have a lot to offer, but the show never gave women Crawley’s age a chance to find love in this format. If this season proves to be successful, it will open the door for more women her age (and older) to participate in the future. The same goes for older men.</p><h2 id=plus-she-s-comfortable-in-her-skin><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Plus: She’s Comfortable In Her Skin</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-5.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a woman is approaching 40, she is likely to be more comfortable in her own skin than a younger woman, who may still be figuring things out. It’s evident that Crawley is self-assured and at ease with herself, which will allow her to express herself on The Bachelorette, without holding back. Her ability to focus on the big picture won’t be compromised by insecurity or self-doubt. This will be appealing to the men.</p><h2 id=problem-she-may-hear-her-biological-clock-ticking><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Problem: She May Hear Her “Biological Clock” Ticking</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-6.jpg><p>Let’s assume that Crawley wants kids one day. These days, women are having babies later in life, but 39 is no “spring chicken” in terms of pregnancy. The guy she chooses should be prepared to get the family thing going pretty soon. There may not be much time as a couple if a baby is a top priority. Whoever Crawley chooses must be on the same page when it comes to starting a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Were The Most Controversial Contestants On The Bachelorette?</a></span></p><h2 id=problem-if-the-guys-are-younger-she-ll-be-labeled-a-cougar><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Problem: If The Guys Are Younger, She’ll Be Labeled A “Cougar”</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-7.jpg><p>There’s a good chance that Crawley will find a guy who is younger than she is on the show. That’s perfectly fine, as men date women younger than they are all the time. Still, the whole “cougar” label seems to stick, even if the woman isn’t that much older than the man she’s with. Crawley better get her claws out! She’s sure to fall for at least one contestant who was born in a different decade.</p><h2 id=problem-some-viewers-may-see-her-as-desperate-to-find-a-husband><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Problem: Some Viewers May See Her As Desperate To Find A Husband</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clare-Crawley-8.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this stage in life, Crawley must be beyond ready to walk down the aisle. Some viewers may think this is her last-ditch effort to find a mate. She’ll be weeding through these guys like she’s at a yard sale, and hopefully one of them is truly her perfect match. If she only accepts a proposal to create the illusion of a successful finale, her relationship is doomed to fail.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Bachelor Series Is Coming!

If she does not find a man who’s “husband material,” she will have to start from scratch. All the days away from home and seeking out love on reality TV will have been a waste of time, and Crawley will have to return to “traditional” dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once she’s a famous face from being on the show, it may make it even harder for her to find a husband who’s sincere.
