Sure, <a href=#>Dynevor had some big roles</a> in addition to that of Daphne Bridgerton too, but it seems that her big break led to the same epiphany Page had. Of course, it later turned out that Page had always intended to only appear in one season of Bridgerton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In contrast, Dynevor never indicated that she planned to leave the show, so her romantic partner's departure seemed to be a sign of foreboding. Recently, Phoebe confirmed that she won't appear in the third season of Bridgerton. The abrupt admission on a red carpet wasn't accompanied by a formal statement from Netflix, either. The sudden news left fans to wonder how the show will fare without her—and whether there's anything that could change the future of her character on the show.</p><h2 id=phoebe-dynevor-fought-hard-for-bridgerton>Phoebe Dynevor Fought Hard For Bridgerton</h2><p>From the moment she was cast as Daphne, it seemed that Phoebe Dynevor worked hard at her job. Even beforehand, she was so hopeful for a role on Bridgerton that <a href=#>she lied to get the gig</a>.</p><p>It all paid off when she became a fan favorite, and her character's storyline enchanted audiences.</p><p>Then Rege-Jean Page left, and things seemed to go downhill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="‘Bridgerton’: Regé-Jean Page’s Exit Reportedly Caused Phoebe Dynevor’s Screen Time To Be Cut">‘Bridgerton’: Regé-Jean Page’s Exit Reportedly Caused Phoebe Dynevor’s Screen Time To Be Cut</a></span></p><p>Without her picture-perfect love interest, Daphne faded a bit. But was it that dip in screen time that led her to pursue other projects? It doesn't sound like it, not based on what Dynevor explained in an interview about her departure.</p><p>In fact, it doesn't sound like the decision was hers at all, though she does seem to have come to terms with it.</p><h2 id=why-is-phoebe-dynevor-leaving-bridgerton>Why Is Phoebe Dynevor Leaving Bridgerton?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bridgerton-phoebe-dynevor.jpg><p>In an interview, Phoebe admitted that Bridgerton had changed her life, but she elaborated that it wasn't just the opportunities the role brought her. She noted struggles on set, working very hard to the point where it impacted her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But in that interview, Dynevor also spoke about how she had forged friendships with amazing people and loved the work she was doing.</p><p>The official reason she will leave the series, then, remains unclear. In a red-carpet interview with Screen Rant, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoebe admitted that her character won't be involved in season three</a> of Bridgerton.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="A Look At Andrew Garfield and Phoebe Dynevor's Relationship">A Look At Andrew Garfield and Phoebe Dynevor's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Dynevor's response to the question of whether Daphne had any "exciting dynamics" coming up was "Sadly not in season 3. Potentially in the future. But season 3, I'm just excited to watch as a viewer."</p><p>Though some have speculated that Dynevor is leaving the show for personal reasons, so far, she hasn't seemed to admit that there's anything behind her departure other than the show's storyline changing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-is-phoebe-dynevor-missing-out-on-for-bridgerton>How Much Money Is Phoebe Dynevor Missing Out On For Bridgerton?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Phoebe-Dynevor-as-Daphne-in-a-scene-of-Bridgerton-via-Film-Daily-4.jpg><p>One obvious downside to Phoebe not appearing on Bridgerton is her missing out on a paycheck for the third season. While <a href=#>her salary hasn't been published to date</a>, It was rumored that Rege-Jean was offered $50,000 per episode to guest star in the series, a stunning offer for someone who left the series entirely.</p><p>In Dynevor's case, however, it may have been planned that her character would not have an arc in the third season, which could be why she didn't seem too worried about not having a storyline.</p><p>If that's the case, it's possible she took on other projects in preparation for a Bridgerton break.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Phoebe Dynevor Describes Regé-Jean Page’s Exit From ‘Bridgerton’ As ‘Very Sad’ For Everyone">Phoebe Dynevor Describes Regé-Jean Page’s Exit From ‘Bridgerton’ As ‘Very Sad’ For Everyone</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the success of the show, though, it's possible that Phoebe was earning upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars for her role as Daphne. Similarly successful series—like Stranger Things—have apparently been able to more than quintuple their income as the shows grow in popularity.</p><p>Of course, unlike Rege-Jean, Phoebe doesn't have bargaining power; she was apparently not asked to return for season three, while producers were hoping to wrangle Page into staying longer.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another interview about her departure from the show</a>, Dynevor noted, "I did my two seasons. I've done what I wanted to do with that character and she had a great arc."</p><p>The statement almost sounds as if she knew the role would only last two seasons—or has at least come to terms with it winding down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress elaborated, "If they ask me back in the future, who knows? For now, I am just really enjoying having new experiences and making films and we'll see what happens."</p><p>That statement makes it sound as if Dynevor has formally been let go from the show, with no promise of a return.</p><p>However, there could be more to the story, depending on a variety of factors, including whether the show originally intended to focus on a separate couple each season, thereby driving Daphne Bridgerton out of the spotlight regardless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBuvMeonJudXZnGr7HVqKlmpJWWw6q6xmaZq6GUnLKzwM6nZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fphoebe-dynevor-hopes-she-ll-be-invited-back-to-bridgerton-in-the-future-despite-no-season-3-storylin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fphoebe-dynevor-hopes-she-ll-be-invited-back-to-bridgerton-in-the-future-despite-no-season-3-storylin.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-hopes-she-ll-be-invited-back-to-bridgerton-in-the-future-despite-no-season-3-storylin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fphoebe-dynevor-hopes-she-ll-be-invited-back-to-bridgerton-in-the-future-despite-no-season-3-storylin.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-hopes-she-ll-be-invited-back-to-bridgerton-in-the-future-despite-no-season-3-storylin.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-hopes-she-ll-be-invited-back-to-bridgerton-in-the-future-despite-no-season-3-storylin.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rebel-wilson-broke-up-with-jacob-busch-over-text-message.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rebel-wilson-broke-up-with-jacob-busch-over-text-message.html>Rebel Wilson Broke Up With Jacob Busch Over Text Message</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./justin-stapleton-kprc2-bio-wiki-age-height-family-wife-salary-and-net-worth.html>Justin Stapleton KPRC2, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Salary and Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./justin-stapleton-kprc2-bio-wiki-age-height-family-wife-salary-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
