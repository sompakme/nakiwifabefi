Sadly, Hurley's career would later hit the skids which <a href=#>she blames on the fact that she got pregnant</a>.</p><p>Similar to how <a href=#>Anna Nicole Smith once battled for an inheritance</a>, people fought for Hurley's son to get money from his father's side of the family. Sadly, Damian Hurley was cut out of his grandfather's will which makes fans wonder if Hurley's son had a relationship with his dad's father.</p><h2 id=why-was-damian-hurley-cut-out-of-his-grandfather-39-s-will>Why Was Damian Hurley Cut Out Of His Grandfather's Will?</h2><p>On 4 April 2002, Elizabeth Hurley gave birth to her only child, her son Damian Hurley. At the time of Damian Hurley's birth, Hurley claimed that an American businessman, philanthropist, film producer, and screenwriter named Steve Bing was the father of her child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/elizabeth-hurley-and-her-son-damian-hurley-when-he-was-a-child-from-her-instagram.jpg><p>Unfortunately for Hurley, Bing initially denied that he was the father of Damian Hurley. More than that, Bing reportedly stated he was only briefly involved with Hurley and that their relationship was non-exclusive. After a paternity test was conducted, it was confirmed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bing was Damian Hurley's biological father</a>.</p><p>During the early 20th century, members of Steve Bing's family became extremely developing real estate. As a result, when Steve Bing's father Dr. Peter Bing passed away, he left behind a £180 fortune in a trust that his will dictated would be split between his grandchildren.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-elizabeth-hurley-s-son-damian-have-a-relationship-with-his-grandfather-before-being-cut-out-of-his-will_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Steve Bing's son, it seemed like Damian Hurley was set to inherit a lot of money. At least, that was the case until a protracted legal battle began to play out over what would happen to the trust Damian Hurley's grandfather left behind.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Elizabeth Hurley Really Thought Of Her Bedazzled Co-Star, Brendan Fraser</a></span></p><p>In court, Steve Bing's sister argued that Dr. Peter Bing was very specific that only his grandchildren born in wedlock should get part of his estate. In court papers, Steve Bing fought on behalf of his son and his daughter from another relationship to get part of his grandfather's trust.</p><p>Steve Bing even went so far as to allege that his sister and father conspired together to have his children including disinherited. In 2019, Judge Daniel Juarez sided with Steve Bing and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled that Damian Hurley must get a piece of his grandfather's trust</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tragically for everyone who cared about Steve Bing, he passed away in 2020 after deciding he no longer wanted to live. Later, the legal battle over Damian Hurley getting part of his grandfather's trust was renewed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/elizabeth-hurley-and-her-son-damian-hurley-looking-annoyed.jpg><p>In July 2021, a new trial over the trust Damian Hurley's grandfather left behind came to an end. Unfortunately for Damian Hurley, that lawsuit ended with a ruling that completely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cut him out of his grandfather's will</a>.</p><p>In response to that ruling, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Hurley released a statement expressing her outrage</a>. Furthermore, Hurley pointed out that Steve Bing would have been very upset by the turn of events.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When Stephen took his own life, he died thinking his children were going to be taken care of. What Stephen wanted has now been callously reversed. I know Stephen would have been devastated. Stephen fought very hard in his last year to have his children recognised<strong> </strong>and repeatedly told me how incredibly important this was to him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman Refused To Give His Children Any of His Humongous Estate After His Death, Here's Who Got It Instead</a></span></p><p>Hurley's statement continued, "He was happy beyond belief that the trial verdict ruled that Damian was to be treated like his sister's children as far as the trust was concerned. I am just relieved that Stephen will never know that Damian's relatives — Stephen's father and the family of his sister Mary — were ultimately successful in their appeal against the original trial verdict."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Steve Bing passed away, he had a daughter named Kira with the tennis pro, Lisa Bonder. Just like Damian Hurley, Kira Bonder was cut out of her grandfather's will and her mother Lisa Bonder put out a similarly angry statement.</p><p>"As a mum, I wonder why on earth this had to happen. Why make two innocent kids into victims?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/elizabeth-hurley-movies-and-tv-shows-career.jpg><p>As Elizabeth Hurley pointed out in her statement, there is no doubt that Steve Bing fought hard to have both his kids get part of the trust. As a result, it seems extremely safe to say he would have been upset with what happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, it is worth noting that according to a separate Daily Mail article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Bing also disinherited both of his children</a>. At the very least, it seems completely clear that Elizabeth Hurley will never do the same thing to her son.</p><h2 id=did-damian-hurley-have-a-relationship-with-his-father-and-grandfather>Did Damian Hurley Have A Relationship With His Father And Grandfather?</h2><p>When The BBC reported that a paternity test had confirmed that Steve Bing was Damian Hurley's father, their piece revealed something else. According to the BBC, Steve Bing had pledged to do two things if Damian Hurley proved to be his son.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Did Robin Williams Leave All His Money To And Why Did It Spark Such A Bitter Family Feud?</a></span></p><p>First off, Steve Bing stated that he would "generously support" Damian Hurley. Secondly and more importantly, the BBC reported that Steve Bing assured Elizabeth Hurley about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what kind of fatherly role he would have in Damian Hurley's life</a>.</p><p>"If indeed I am the father, I will be an extremely involved and responsible parent."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/daian-hurley-wearing-a-colorful-suit.jpg><p>Despite what the BBC reported about what kind of father Steve Bing said he would be, The Daily Mail claimed the reality was very different. According to The Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Bing didn't have much of an active role in Damian Hurley's life</a>.</p><p>"Damian and Steve's relationship had almost been non-existent for most of the teen's life, but in the weeks before his death, the multi-millionaire businessman had made tentative steps towards establishing a father-son bond, calling him for the first time on his 18th birthday." Steve Bing passed away within months of Damian Hurley's 18th birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unless Damian Hurley definitively says if he had a relationship with his grandfather, there is no way for the public to know for sure if he did. However, considering that Steve Bing only briefly communicated with his son according to reports, it seems very likely that Damian Hurley didn't get to know his paternal grandfather, Peter Bing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmrmqxsCbnK2gXZ3Cs7jEsqpmq5%2BjeqWtzKKYp2WYlsOmecBmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaeewal5xquYp5yWlsGpsdFmmZ6en6eybq7EoqWgZZOqwW671K1kqJ5drLatuI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-elizabeth-hurley-s-son-damian-have-a-relationship-with-his-grandfather-before-being-cut-out-of-h.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-elizabeth-hurley-s-son-damian-have-a-relationship-with-his-grandfather-before-being-cut-out-of-h.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-elizabeth-hurley-s-son-damian-have-a-relationship-with-his-grandfather-before-being-cut-out-of-h.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-elizabeth-hurley-s-son-damian-have-a-relationship-with-his-grandfather-before-being-cut-out-of-h.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-elizabeth-hurley-s-son-damian-have-a-relationship-with-his-grandfather-before-being-cut-out-of-h.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-elizabeth-hurley-s-son-damian-have-a-relationship-with-his-grandfather-before-being-cut-out-of-h.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./emily-ratajkowski-eric-andre-sit-courtside-at-knicks-game.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./emily-ratajkowski-eric-andre-sit-courtside-at-knicks-game.html>Emily Ratajkowski, Eric Andre Sit Courtside at Knicks Game</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cliff-dixon-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Cliff Dixon Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cliff-dixon-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
