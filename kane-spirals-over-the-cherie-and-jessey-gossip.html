After dissolving a tablet of ketamine into his mouth and sucking on some laughing gas, Kelly watches as Kane gets his nose and chin threaded, promoting the growth of collagen to add structure to his look.The two then meet Kevin for dinner where Kevin expresses his concern that Kane might be hurting himself with these procedures. "Tomorrow, you're gonna fall in love with my face again," Kane assures him. Despite copious amounts of face-freezing botox and fillers, Kane seems unable to hide his true colors.<span class=article-alert>Spoiler Alert: The rest of this article contains spoilers from Bling Empire season 2, episode 2: 'Rumor Has It'</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kane-delves-into-cherie-s-personal-life>Kane Delves Into Cherie's Personal Life</h2><p>At a get together at Guy Tang's house, Jaime reveals to Kelly the news she received from Leah about Cherie regarding whether Cherie knows that Jessey had a wife and two children when the couple met. The pair then turn to the group to gather their opinions about whether to discuss their findings with Cherie.</p><p>As a close friend of Cherie's, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real estate agent, Kane</a>, takes it upon himself to "find out the truth," though Kevin worries Kane's aptitude for gossip may create unnecessary drama.

Leah reveals that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherie was dating an ex named Alex before she met Jessey</a>. Alex introduced Cherie to Jessey and his wife, Crystal, with whom he shares two children. Alex and Cherie called it quits upon finding out that Cherie and Jessey were involved.</p><p>Kane takes the shocking information personally, questioning his relationship with Cherie. "This is not the Cherie I knew," Kane says, upset that he had to hear this news about Cherie's personal life from a third party rather than from the horse's mouth. With that, Kane plops the table's bread in his bag and departs, prepared to wallow in food.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-opens-up-about-her-relationship-struggles>Kim Opens Up About Her Relationship Struggles</h2><p>Excited about the prospect of a relationship with Kim, Kevin pays for a private date with a chef named Jasper whose intent was to offer the couple a gourmet meal in conjunction with teaching them about the art of preparing a fish. Flowers in hand, Kevin arrives at the dinner spot, telling Jasper he's going to be accompanied by a special someone.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Julie And Melissa Hash It Out On The Real World Homecoming: New Orleans</a></span></p><p>At 8:08 PM, Kevin tries calling Kim to no avail. "Kim's always on time, if not early," Kevin insists, calling her once again at 8:25 PM. Finally, at 8:44 PM, Kevin tries Kim for the final time. When received by her voice mailbox once again, Kevin decides to give up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At Guy's party, Kevin and Kim run into each other for the first time since she stood him up on their date, and though she tried to avoid the conversation, Kevin pulls her aside and asks her for an explanation. "I'm not sure if I wanna go there with you," Kim admits, adding that she doesn't want to lose their friendship were they not to work out. Despite his mild heartbreak, Kevin accepts her apology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kevin-kreider-bling-empire.jpg><p>At Kelly's house later in the week, Kim sits with Kelly and her mom, Kimmy, and further divulges that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the reason she avoided a date with Kevin was due to past relationship trauma</a> where she felt betrayed by her ex. "When I'm in a relationship," Kim notes through teary eyes, "I give my all, and that's very scary to me." Kimmy assures her that "time heals everything," allowing Kim to breathe a hopeful sigh of relief.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>RHONJ Season 12 Episode 15 Review: 'Reunion Part 2'</a></span></p><h2 id=viewers-question-kim-s-intentions>Viewers Question Kim's Intentions</h2><p>Despite Kim having opened up to Kelly and her mother about past relationship turmoil, fans are still upset that she wasn't mature enough to own up to her feelings in conversation with Kevin. Rather than being real with him, she decided the best course of action was to stand him up, proving that she may not be on the right track toward becoming a successful partner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kane-s-affinity-for-gossip-is-sure-to-get-messy>Kane's Affinity For Gossip Is Sure To Get Messy</h2><p>While Kane claims that his want to get to the bottom of things with the Cherie gossip is out of the goodness of his heart and want to maintain a closeness with her as friends. However, it seems the twinkle in his eye that arises upon hearing and spreading rumors will prove to be a saboteur. His sit down with Leah and Jaime seemed to be for no reason other than to further intwine himself in the gossip. If he's going to preserve the friendship he cherishes with Cherie, he'll need to heed Kevin's advice and take a step back from the rumor mill.</p><p>Season 2 of <strong>Bling Empire</strong> is currently streaming, only on <strong>Netflix</strong>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Cherie And Jessey's Relationship Is Called Into Question On Bling Empire</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpaGenHqmuc%2BiqZ5lo5qutLvNZmlmnaCewLCwxGZpZqqloryzeceaqmahpGK%2FpsLInq5o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkane-spirals-over-the-cherie-and-jessey-gossip.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkane-spirals-over-the-cherie-and-jessey-gossip.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkane-spirals-over-the-cherie-and-jessey-gossip.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkane-spirals-over-the-cherie-and-jessey-gossip.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkane-spirals-over-the-cherie-and-jessey-gossip.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkane-spirals-over-the-cherie-and-jessey-gossip.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nicola-coughlan-hosts-epic-pump-rules-costume-party-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nicola-coughlan-hosts-epic-pump-rules-costume-party-photos.html>Nicola Coughlan Hosts Epic Pump Rules Costume Party: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jimmy-jacobs-says-his-job-at-aew-does-not-really-involve-writing-television.html>Jimmy Jacobs Says His Job At AEW Does Not Really Involve Writing Television</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jimmy-jacobs-says-his-job-at-aew-does-not-really-involve-writing-television.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
