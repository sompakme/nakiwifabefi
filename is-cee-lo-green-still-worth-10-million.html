Although his rise to stardom as a solo artist didn’t happen overnight, the “Forget You” hitmaker had proven that he’s not just a talented singer but also an incredible songwriter.</p><p>He later decided to work on his next project — Gnarls Barkley, which was a collaboration with DJ Danger Mouse, with who he would release two albums with. Their biggest hit was “Crazy,” which entered the top five in over fifteen countries, including the U.S. and U.K.</p><p>CeeLo has made a fortune from publishing royalties, but one shouldn’t forget that he also spent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">three years as a judge and coach on the US edition of The Voice</a> — all of this begs the question of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whether he’s still worth $10 million</a>?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-s-ceelo-green-s-net-worth>What’s CeeLo Green’s Net Worth?</h2><p>CeeLo is very much still worth $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>As previously mentioned, most of his earnings came from his music career, which has not only seen him join several groups but also take on a solo career of his own.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Voice: Here’s What The Judges Think Of The Show</a></span></p><p>To date, the 45-year-old has released a whopping six albums and has shipped over five million albums worldwide. While CeeLo had always been signed to a major record label, his latest offering with 2020 CeeLo Green Is Thomas Callaway, he opted to release the project independently.</p><p>As part of the duo Gnarls Barkley, he sold another two million units from the albums St. Elsewhere and The Odd Couple. Given that he wrote and co-produced a string of the songs on both records, trust and believe that the father of one would have definitely made a lot of money thanks to the generous sales he amassed from his involvement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even his fellow musical peers have jumped at any chance they could to work with him, such as Kelis who collaborated with CeeLo for her song “Lil Star,” or Bruno Mars’ “The Other Side,” Mac Miller’s “We” and Offset’s “North Star.”</p><p>To say that CeeLo is a respected artist, songwriter and producer is clearly an understatement.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Lesser-Known Facts From The Set Of ‘The Voice’</a></span></p><p>In 2011, he agreed to join the NBC talent series The Voice, alongside Christina Aguilera, Blake Shelton, and Adam Levine. For the first season, he reportedly made $2 million, but after the show proved to be a huge ratings winner for the network, his salary was revised to a whopping $6.5 million up until his departure in Season 6.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it didn’t compare to the amount of money some of the other judges were making (Xtina earned up to $15 million per season), CeeLo still made a fortune during his time on the talent show.</p><p>The “Fool For You” hitmaker was forced to leave The Voice after facing charges in a felony drug case. He had also pled no contest to allegedly giving a woman ecstasy at a 2012 dinner before completing his sentenced community service.</p><p>Speaking about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially returning as a judge in the future</a>, CeeLo said, "I've talked very possibly about doing&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;again. So I just kind of put that out there, wishful thinking, kind of willing it. Because I would love to do it again.”</p><p>"And I'm so grateful that you yourself, and everyone who just may happen to witness this particular interview, have my deepest, sincerest apologies for any inconvenience, any ignorance, any ill will, anything. I'm just glad that it's behind me now. I'm so glad for it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘The Voice’: Who Is The Highest-Paid Judge?</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Since the felony drug case came to light</a>, CeeLo lost quite a lot of support from fans, sponsors, and his work colleagues — and though a statement claimed he willingly left The Voice, it’s been said that producers allegedly fired him due to the negative attention it was bringing to NBC’s highest-rated reality show.</p><p>CeeLo has carried on making music with some of the biggest artists in the world, having also utilized his spare time to work on his solo projects, but TV seems to be something he would definitely want to make a return to in the near future.</p><p>But one has to wonder who’s going to hire him following such a scandal. Needless to say, however, he still has his $10 million to fall back on in case his music career never achieves the success it had even just 10 years ago — but that’s why it’s good to write and produce songs because the royalties to a smash hit such as “Forget You” will always bring in a steady paycheck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To CeeLo Green After ‘The Voice’?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianp1dobxus9GenKdlYWV6rrXLpaCopl2jsrV51qipraBf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-cee-lo-green-still-worth-10-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-cee-lo-green-still-worth-10-million.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-cee-lo-green-still-worth-10-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-cee-lo-green-still-worth-10-million.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-cee-lo-green-still-worth-10-million.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-cee-lo-green-still-worth-10-million.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jaxson-lynn-woodland-age-how-old-is-gary-woodland-s-son.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jaxson-lynn-woodland-age-how-old-is-gary-woodland-s-son.html>Jaxson Lynn Woodland Age: How old is Gary Woodlands son?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dua-lipa-confirmed-that-she-won-t-be-performing-at-world-cup.html>Dua Lipa Confirmed That She Wont Be Performing At World Cup</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dua-lipa-confirmed-that-she-won-t-be-performing-at-world-cup.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
