It was first held in San Francisco, California from 1987-2011 before moving to Southern California for Anaheim in 2012.</p><p>This convention was created by the same people behind the San Diego Comic Con, so it has a similar vibe, but it's much smaller and more intimate and attendees have noted that the smaller crowds mean a&nbsp;less chaotic atmosphere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=d23-expo---50-000>19.

D23 is the official fan club for the Walt Disney Company with the "D" standing for Disney, and "23" standing for 1923, the year Walt first arrived in Hollywood.

In 2014, attendance was up to 65,000.</p><p>The convention has attracted numerous celebrities such as Weird Al, Adam West, Todd McFarlane, and Kevin&nbsp;Smith. With the numbers growing at this rate, this convention is set to give some of the larger Cons a run for their money in the near future.</p><p></p><h2 id=wizard-world-chicago---70-000>14. Wizard World Chicago - 70,000</h2><p>www.gopixpic.com</p><p>Not to be confused with the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, Wizard World Chicago was founded in 1972 and held over a course of three days in the summer. It is one of the larger comic book conventions in North America and attracts over 70,000 attendees each year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The conference recently expanded from focusing solely on comic books to professional wrestling, web comics, fantasy novels, television, horror, anime, manga, cartoons, and more.</p><p></p><h2 id=emerald-city-comicon---70-000>13.

It's the largest geek convention in the state of Washington and is held over the course of three days.</p><p>The event has had to move locations on a regular basis due to the growing number of attendees each year and the consequent need for a bigger, more suitable space.

This is a convention exclusively for gamers, which means that the fan base for this one is&nbsp;completely unique and more 'niche' than the other conventions on this list.</p><p></p><h2 id=animeexpo---80-000>11. AnimeExpo - 80,000</h2><p>nerdreactor.com</p><p>AnimeExpo is an annual anime convention held in Los Angeles, California boasting over 80,000 attendees in 2014.

Each year, the convention is hosted in the Big Apple. It's a running joke that NYCC is always competing with the SDCC, and it seems that New York wins out in the battle of the Cons with over 20,000 more attendees than its West Coast competitor. NYCC also hosts a week-long event called "Super Week" leading up to the main event, with over 110 events in multiple locations around the city.</p><p></p><h2 id=japan-expo---240-000>4.

In fact, the event has become so big that it has even bred smaller conventions known as the "Chibi Japan Expo" as well as "Japan Expo USA" held in California. It has lately become one of the most highly anticipated&nbsp;conventions in Europe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=lucca-comics-amp-games---240-000>3. Lucca Comics & Games - 240,000</h2><p>www.steampunkitalia.com</p><p>While you're in the hills of Tuscany, not only can you enjoy the stunning landscape of Italy, but you can also attend one of the largest comic book and gaming conventions in the world.</p><p>Starting in 1966, Lucca Comics & Games was originally called&nbsp;<i>Salone Internazionale del Comics </i>and has grown steadily over the years. Located in Lucca, Tuscany, the town is taken over by large tents each year, in unique contrast to the medieval city landscape. The event hosts over 240,000 attendees each year, with additional thousands left disappointed when tickets sell out.</p><p></p><h2 id=gamescom---335-000>2. gamescom - 335,000</h2><p>www.playnation.de</p><p>Held in Cologne, Germany each year, gamescom is the world's largest gaming convention and event.

It's a win-win for both game developers and attendees. People who go to gamescom have the opportunity to test out and even purchase games before they are available on the market, while the Con presents a great marketing opportunity for game developers as they get the benefit of increased exposure and endless&nbsp;Beta testing opportunities.</p><p></p><h2 id=comiket---590-000>1. Comiket - 590,000</h2><p>www.japantimes.co.jp</p><p>The name "Comiket" is the abbreviated version of the full name, "Comic Market." Starting in 1975 with only 600 attendees, Comiket has grown to have over 590,000 attendees and the event is now held twice a year.</p><p>People have actually lined up at the doors of the convention's location days in advance so they can get first dibs on buying different products, although the city of Tokyo has tried to ban the practice due to the problems the crowds present to the city. This particular convention is so popular because fans&nbsp;can find the largest collection of self-published manga, and some exceptionally rare and valuable items are on sale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2glWLEsL7LnapmamBir6qzxp6qrWWXmrKsecKopa%2Bdnqm2sLrSaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-world-s-20-biggest-geek-conventions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-world-s-20-biggest-geek-conventions.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-world-s-20-biggest-geek-conventions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-world-s-20-biggest-geek-conventions.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-world-s-20-biggest-geek-conventions.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-world-s-20-biggest-geek-conventions.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./empire-records-cast-where-are-they-now-liv-tyler-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./empire-records-cast-where-are-they-now-liv-tyler-and-more.html>'Empire Records' Cast: Where Are They Now?
