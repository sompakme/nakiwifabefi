Once earning a living through babysitting, she is now one of the most successful women in Hollywood. She is a single mom of two kids, and she has a lot of help so that she is able to work while raising them. So how exactly does Kaling spend her money? Fans might be curious to know. Let's take a deep dive into her life.</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-has-assistants><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Has Assistants</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaling has had a few different assistants over the years to help navigate her busy work life and hectic schedule. For the last few years, her assistant was Elena Dole, who helped get Kaling through the pandemic and texted her that she "can do this!" when she went to the hospital to give birth to her second child alone. Kaling has always hired women as her assistants who end up becoming great friends of hers, even though she pays them.</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-hired-a-baby-nurse><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Hired A Baby Nurse</span></h2><p>Kaling stated in one of her essays for Amazon Prime that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she hired a baby nurse for her first child</a> and planned to hire her for her second, as well, which was born a couple of years later. As a single parent, she felt it was worth the money to spend on someone who woke her up in the middle of the night when it was time to breastfeed and to have someone who was an expert in caring for babies to help her navigate life as a new mom. She stated in her essay that she no longer has a mom, as she passed away from pancreatic cancer several years ago, but she had her baby nurse to help her navigate the new role in her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mindy-kaling-has-a-personal-designer><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Has A Personal Designer</span></h2><p>Kaling has worked with fashion and costume designer Salvador Perez Jr. on multiple shows as well as in real life. Perez has designed many custom pieces for Kaling to wear to award shows and movie premieres over the years. The Paley Center in Los Angeles featured a collection of his pieces for The Mindy Project for a limited time when fans could go and view them in person.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Mindy Kaling Say No To 'SNL'?</a></span></p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-loves-fashion><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Loves Fashion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to an interview on thatsitla.com with fashion designer Perez, Kaling's clothes and shoe collection are "ridiculous." No doubt the actress spends a ton on fashion items such as shoes and handbags as well as clothing items. She can obviously afford to spend the money, so who can blame her?</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-bought-a-house-in-malibu><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Bought A House In Malibu</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaling purchased a house in Malibu in 2020 for $9.55 million</a>. The home she bought used to belong to Frank Sinatra. It even came fully equipped with an elevator. It's also located right by the beach. The house was actually listed for over $11 million, so Kaling got it for a steal. It of course comes with a pool as well as a huge master suite that comes with dual master bathrooms, a steam room, a hair salon and a lounge with a fireplace. Kaling is definitely living the life!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mindy-kaling-shops-at-farmer-39-s-markets><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Shops At Farmer's Markets</span></h2><p>Kaling often goes to her local farmer's market to buy produce to use for meals for her family. She even showed on Instagram how she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made her own baby food</a> for her kids when they were little. She has even bought fresh salmon from there, as well. Remember that time Kaling had Kamala Harris over to help her cook?

She was once spotted out and about shopping at a designer children's clothing store in West Hollywood. She also has her own mini playground for her kids to play on in her backyard. She actually spent $22 thousand dollars on a playhouse for her kids. Talk about some lucky kiddos!</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-travels-to-the-east-coast><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Travels To The East Coast</span></h2><p>Kaling spends a good chunk of money flying herself and her kids to Massachusetts, where she is from, to visit family and friends. Her best friend, B.J. Novak, is also from Massachusetts, and they attended a Red Sox game there together recently. She also got stuck in a snowstorm in January while visiting and got excited for her kids to see snow for the first time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mindy-kaling-donates-to-charities><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mindy Kaling Donates To Charities</span></h2><p>For her 40th birthday, Kaling donated $40,000 to various charities, giving $1,000 to 40 different organizations. She also donated to various charities for her birthday in 2015. The fact that she chooses to give so much on her birthdays instead of focusing on herself says a lot about who she is as a person.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Every Project Mindy Kaling Has Produced So Far</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9doravsNhmopqkmaO0br%2FPnqWdq12dsrN5km5kpqGcobawuoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-mindy-kaling-spends-her-35-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-mindy-kaling-spends-her-35-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-mindy-kaling-spends-her-35-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-mindy-kaling-spends-her-35-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-mindy-kaling-spends-her-35-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-mindy-kaling-spends-her-35-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jackie-miller-why-did-ohio-school-bus-driver-resign.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jackie-miller-why-did-ohio-school-bus-driver-resign.html>Jackie Miller | Why Did Ohio School Bus Driver Resign</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-tyler1-girlfriend-revealed-details-about-macaiyla.html>Who is Tyler1 girlfriend?
