Actors work for hours on end to film just a movie and TV show, and sometimes the pressure they’re subjected to is so much that they just need to catch a break. For example, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tom Holland revealed that filming The Crowded Room was too much</a> and, because of it, decided to take a small break from Hollywood. Other stars who have left Hollywood and moved off the map include <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hilary Swank</a> and Bridget Fonda.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jane Fonda comes from a family of successful actors, so she began acting at a very young age. During her career, Fonda starred in many successful movies, including The GodfatherPart III (1990), Point of No Return (1993), and Kiss of the Dragon (2001).</p><p>However, her career seemed to die down at some point in the early 2000s.

So, it’s safe to say she began acting at a very young age. In fact, Fonda first became involved with the theatre when she was cast in a school production of Harvey. Later on, she studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute as part of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts acting program and then attended NYU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She made her movie debut when she was only five years old by starring alongside her father in the 1969 film Easy Rider. Then, in 1982, she landed a second non-speaking part in the comedy film Partners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar29735206.jpg><p>Although she appeared in many more movies during the 80s, she didn’t get her big break until 1990, when she was cast as a journalist in The Godfather Part III. She then went on to work several years in theater productions but came back to the big screen when she was cast as the lead in Barbet Schroeder's film Single White Female and then in a role in Cameron Crowe's ensemble comedy Singles (both in 1992).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Barbra Streisand Convinced Jane Fonda To Auction Off Her Keepsakes</a></span></p><p>Throughout her career, Bridget <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">appeared in 49 films and TV shows</a>. This includes films such as Point of No Return (1993), It Could Happen to You (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), and A Simple Plan (1998) and series such as The Chris Isaak Show and Night Visions. She also did voice acting for the 1995 animated film Balto.

While she appeared in numerous movies throughout the 80s and 90s, by the early 2000s, Fonda had seemingly decided to quit Hollywood. Turns out that a series of life-changing events were what led her to make this decision.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Things Danny Elfman Gets Up To When He's Not Composing Award-Winning Film Scores</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2003, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fonda survived a brutal car crash in Malibu</a>. According to reports, the actress lost control of her vehicle and ended up rolling her car over an embankment. The media claimed that Bridget had only survived the crash because she had been wearing her seatbelt.</p><p>But the result was that her thoracic vertebrae were fractured and she sustained some minor cuts and bruises. At the time of the accident, the star was set to guest star on the legal drama The Practice, but her part had to be recast and was ultimately played by Meet the Parents star Teri Polo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49007452.jpg><p>In March of that same year, the actress got engaged to film composer and frontman of the band Oingo Boingo, Danny Elfman. At the time, Fonda decided to retire from Hollywood to start a family. She and Elfman got married in November 2003 and welcomed a son into the world only two years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-bridget-fonda-ever-return-to-hollywood>Will Bridget Fonda Ever Return to Hollywood?</h2><p>As of today, Bridget Fonda is still married to Danny Elfman. Although the musician has made the music for iconic movies such as Men in Black, Coraline, Notorious, and Spiderman, the former actress almost never accompanies him to red carpets or movie premieres. In fact, the last time Bridget Fonda was last seen in a premiere was back in 2009.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar42636733.jpg><p>In 2015, Fonda and Elfman purchased a $3.6 million “fixer-upper” home near Hancock Park, Los Angeles. This is where the former actress currently lives. Despite its closeness to Hollywood, Fonda has managed to completely cut ties with the acting industry and has even chosen to avoid social media altogether.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her efforts to stay out of the spotlight, Fonda was spotted by paparazzi at LAX airport earlier this year. When she was asked if she had any plans to get back into acting again, the actress said "No," as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a>. Pressed further, she elaborated, "I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl7%2BqsMaeq2aen6OxonnLnp2tZZikua3F1qimnWWRo7Fuv9OasJ6cXZbEosWMqJ2fZaSdsm65wKlkn6eiYrSwu8No</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-bridget-fonda-left-hollywood-and-stayed-away-off-the-map-for-good.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-bridget-fonda-left-hollywood-and-stayed-away-off-the-map-for-good.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-bridget-fonda-left-hollywood-and-stayed-away-off-the-map-for-good.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-bridget-fonda-left-hollywood-and-stayed-away-off-the-map-for-good.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-bridget-fonda-left-hollywood-and-stayed-away-off-the-map-for-good.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-bridget-fonda-left-hollywood-and-stayed-away-off-the-map-for-good.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./allen-iverson-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./allen-iverson-net-worth-therichest.html>Allen Iverson Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-a-major-outrage-made-will-ferrell-pull-out-of-his-own-film.html>Why A Major Outrage Made Will Ferrell Pull Out Of His Own Film</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-a-major-outrage-made-will-ferrell-pull-out-of-his-own-film.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
