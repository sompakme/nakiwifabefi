He played with multiple local bands in his city and around the school before releasing solo music. In 2011, Rutherford co-created the band Neighborhood, which <a href=#>released a mix of hip-hop, rock</a>, and indie music with a niche audience. Rutherford is the lead singer and a talented songwriter who has contributed significantly to his band's music. Known for his love for fashion and styles, the singer has collaborated with fashion brands to introduce his designs and sell them to the public. Jesse Rutherford has recently become popular in the media for <a href=#>his secret relationship with Billie Eilish</a>. Still, the singer’s talent goes beyond what is seen in the outlets today. From working as a child in shows to performing at large venues with his band, let’s look at who Jesse Rutherford is and how he built his $4 million net worth.</p><h2 id=starting-career-young>Starting Career Young</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Growing up in California, Jesse Rutherford joined the entertainment industry as a child when he performed at talent shows as an Elvis and NSYNC impersonator. His passion for music and acting led him to perform in commercials and films. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Movies</a>, Rutherford made his acting debut with a minor role in 2002 in films such as <i>Bundy</i> and <i>Life Or Something Like It</i>.

He created a 17-song album as a combination of R&B and hip-hop genres. As Rutherford spent time connecting with musicians and bonding with other artists, he got the idea to form a band that could bring his musical visions to life. He created the band The Neighbourhood in 2011, and they released their debut album in 2013, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The band consisted of Rutherford as the lead vocalist, Mikey Margot for the bass, and guitarists Zach Abels and Jeremy Freedman.</p><h2 id=the-rise-of-a-hit-maker>The Rise Of A Hit-Maker</h2><p>Before their debut album in 2013, The Neighbourhood released two singles in 2012: <i>Female Robbery</i> and <i>Sweater Weather</i>.

A little less than a decade later, the song returned to the charts after several mashups of the single went viral on TikTok.

Their debut album, <i>I Love You</i>, has sold over 1.12 million copies worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While continuing his career as a solo artist and band leader, Rutherford released his first book titled <i>&</i> in 2016. It featured photographs of Rutherford himself, who explored gender fluidity with the help of photographer Jessie English.

He uploaded singles on the platform under the alias but opted for his real name while releasing his first solo single, <i>Born To Be Blonde</i>. In 2017, his debut studio album <i>&</i> was released with 11 tracks and no other featured artists. Along with being a musician and author, Jesse Rutherford is also a fashion icon who has been pursuing his passion from a young age.</p><h2 id=moving-beyond-music-too>Moving Beyond Music Too</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A perfect rockstar, Jesse Rutherford has always been fond of fashion.
