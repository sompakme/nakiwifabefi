For several seasons, fans of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery Channel</a> show tuned in to see what Hoffman and his crew were up to as they scoured the northern soil for precious metals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To say that Hoffman has struck it rich over the years is an understatement. The middle-aged father might look scruffy and worse for wear, but he is actually a multi-millionaire! From airports to machinery, companies to cars, Todd Hoffman is a big spender. Check out these surprising things that he has spent his seven million dollar fortune on.</p><h2 id=he-bought-a-small-oregon-airport><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Bought A Small Oregon Airport</span></h2><p>Before mining was ever even on Hoffman's radar, he was the proud owner of a small airport in Oregon. For a spell, this airport served its purpose as a primary income source, but eventually, the industry went dry, and Todd turned his attention elsewhere. While the airport doesn't rake in the big bucks, Todd still owns it.</p><h2 id=hoffman-co-owns-zum-media-productions><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Hoffman Co-Owns Zum Media Productions</span></h2><p>When Todd announced to the world that he was leaving his hit show and turning his attention to other ventures, fans everywhere wondered what he would now do with his time. They didn't have to wait very long to learn that Todd had started up Zum productions. Thus far, the production company hasn't done much other than promise new shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=todd-is-very-proud-of-his-substance-treatment-center><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Todd Is Very Proud Of His Substance&nbsp;Treatment Center</span></h2><p>Todd doesn't just buy up flashy cars and production companies with his millions, at least one of his business ventures is devoted to helping people who struggle with substance abuse. Todd started up a treatment facility to better the lives of those who were down and out. Of everything he has done with his money, he is perhaps most proud of this accomplishment.</p><h2 id=todd-is-pouring-money-and-soul-into-his-music-making><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Todd Is Pouring Money And Soul Into His Music Making</span></h2><p>Todd Hoffman, the music superstar? Hmmm, we don't really see him winning a Grammy anytime soon, but Todd seems to think that he has a fighting chance at musical stardom. Some of his fortune is going towards funding his newly found passion for making music. Currently, fans can check out some of his cover songs on YouTube.</p><h2 id=making-a-movie-might-be-where-his-fortune-is-going><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Making A Movie Might Be Where His Fortune Is Going</span></h2><p>Todd Hoffman is all about making his every entertainment dream come true. First, there was chatter of his new production company creating a new reality show, among other projects. Todd started to fund his musical aspirations, and he even seems to be thinking of creating and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">producing big-time films</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=creating-a-reality-spinoff-will-take-some-cash><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Creating A Reality Spinoff Will Take Some Cash</span></h2><p>Fans were pumped up when they heard that Hoffman and his newly founded Zum productions were turning their energies and funds to a brand new reality series called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenhorn Gold</a>. Not a whole lot of information has come out regarding the release date of the show, but we are keeping our fingers crossed!</p><h2 id=a-wash-plant-set-him-back-a-pretty-penny><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>A Wash Plant Set Him Back A Pretty Penny</span></h2><p>During&nbsp;his mining days, Hoffman invested in not one... not two... but THREE wash plants! Wash plants are used water and sedimentation to remove ore from the general dirt. Three might be considered to be excessive for a small mining operation, but Todd clearly likes to go big or go home.</p><h2 id=a-mining-operation-in-guyana-south-america-flopped-and-it-wasn-t-cheap><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>A Mining Operation In Guyana, South America Flopped And It Wasn't Cheap</span></h2><p>Todd took his operation way south to Guyana in hopes of bringing back the gold. The excursion wasn't cheap, and the payout wasn't precisely what he had hoped for. The trip proved so disastrous that Hoffman has referred to it as "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his biggest mistake</a>." Maybe it really is time to move on from mining.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-invested-in-a-production-and-finance-company-called-gold-standard-television><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Invested In A Production And Finance Company Called Gold Standard Television</span></h2><p>Aside from Zum productions, Todd has also invested in a production and finance company called Gold Standard Television. The company has offices in Los Angeles, and Hoffman jointly runs it with&nbsp;veteran producer Jose Behar. With all Hoffman is doing behind the scenes, perhaps we underestimated him. Maybe he will be the next big thing in entertainment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Fakest Discovery Channel Shows (And 10 That Are Actually Real)</a></span></p><h2 id=hoffman-took-a-chance-and-invested-1-million-in-mining-equipment><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Hoffman Took A Chance And Invested $1 Million In Mining Equipment</span></h2><p>You know what they say, you have to spend money to make money! Todd Hoffman invested a cool million dollars into his mining venture by purchasing plenty of equipment to make his operation run to the maximum. This roll of the dice proved to be pretty lucrative for the reality star as he has made millions of dollars from digging up gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-1972-chevrolet-camaro-gets-todd-s-motor-running><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A 1972 Chevrolet Camaro&nbsp;Gets Todd's Motor Running</span></h2><p>Todd Hoffman loves his cars, and he has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased several of them</a> with the fortune that he has made with mining. One of his favorite automobiles is a 1972 Chevy Camaro that he spent time restoring. He put a new LS motor in the vintage car and considers it one of it his prized possessions.</p><h2 id=his-1949-chevy-3100-five-window-truck><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>His 1949 Chevy 3100 Five-Window Truck</span></h2><p>Hoffman likes flashy cars like his old Camaro, but he also has a penchant for rusty old trucks that look like they belong in a landfill. He owns a 1949 Chevy 3100 Five Window truck that looks nearly dead on the outside, but it's all souped up in the inside. This way, his vehicle has the very best of the old and the new.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Shows You Can Find On Discovery Channel (And 5 To Avoid)</a></span></p><h2 id=a-2017-ram-2500-is-todd-s-go-to-vehicle><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>A&nbsp;2017 Ram 2500 Is Todd's Go To Vehicle</span></h2><p>Todd's 2017 Ram 2500 is the car that we saw him driving on Gold Rush. While he owns several vehicles, this is the study one that gets him where he needs to go. The Ram is the one for him, but he is Chevy all the way when it comes to his family. His wife drives a Chevy Suburban.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hoffman-owns-a-tripped-out-motorhome><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Hoffman Owns A Tripped-Out Motorhome</span></h2><p>The Hoffmans have a motorhome so that they can travel all over in style. He sometimes loads the guys up in his big, diesel motorhome and hits the road. He has even taken the RV up to the Klondike to mine gold. We love the idea of getting behind the wheel of a home on wheels and canvassing the north.</p><h2 id=a-car-show-could-prove-profitable><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Car Show Could Prove Profitable</span></h2><p>Todd Hoffman took to social media to announce his partnership with Pluto streaming and his big upcoming project: a car show! He loves the entertainment industry, and he loves himself some cars, so why not? He and a few other guys have apparently been offered&nbsp;the television concept of a car show with a twist. We can't wait to hear what the twist is.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Fake Things About Discovery's Gold Rush</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieqKSUYr%2B2v8dmq6iclGK1sLLFppinZaOlsq%2Bw0mafoqtdbHqutculoKimXZm8rbjAq2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgold-rush-15-surprising-ways-todd-hoffman-spends-his-7-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgold-rush-15-surprising-ways-todd-hoffman-spends-his-7-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgold-rush-15-surprising-ways-todd-hoffman-spends-his-7-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgold-rush-15-surprising-ways-todd-hoffman-spends-his-7-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgold-rush-15-surprising-ways-todd-hoffman-spends-his-7-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgold-rush-15-surprising-ways-todd-hoffman-spends-his-7-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meet-big-chief-girlfriend-jackie-braasch-on-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meet-big-chief-girlfriend-jackie-braasch-on-instagram.html>Meet Big Chief Girlfriend Jackie Braasch On Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eve-reacts-to-nicki-minaj-s-controversial-paper-magazine-cover.html>Eve Reacts to Nicki Minajs Controversial Paper Magazine Cover</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eve-reacts-to-nicki-minaj-s-controversial-paper-magazine-cover.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
