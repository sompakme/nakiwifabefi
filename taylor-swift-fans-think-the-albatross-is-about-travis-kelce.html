She’ll ruin your career,’” one social media user said via <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a>. “‘Are you paying attention to football? Is she weighing you down? Is he no longer good because he’s dating Taylor Swift?’ That was the entire middle part of their relationship when everybody was so pissed they saw her on the screen.”</p><p class=p1>Swift and Kelce <a href=#>started dating in summer 2023</a> after a missed connection at her <i>Eras Tour </i>that July. They took their romance to the next level when she went to her first Chiefs game in September 2023. Despite Swift eagerly embracing football for the first time, <a href=#>die-hard sports enthusiasts lamented</a> that she was shown on broadcasts more than the game itself and thought Kelce’s stats would be negatively affected. (The beliefs were ultimately proven to be false as Kelce broke many receiving records and helped the Chiefs clinch a second consecutive Super Bowl trophy.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Taylor-Swift-Fans-Think-The-Albatross-Is-About-Travis-Kelce-2.jpg><p class=p1>“I don’t know how they know what suite I’m in. There’s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don’t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don’t know if I’m being shown 17 times or once,” Swift told <i>TIME</i> in her <a href=#>2023 Person of the Year profile</a>. “I’m just there to support Travis. I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads and Chads.”</p><p class=p1>Since hearing “The Albatross,” other Swifties have noticed that the track seemingly highlights the unexpected situations and “baggage” that comes with being in a relationship with Swift.</p><p class=p1>“The first verse talks about someone warning a suitor about dating her. Love is fragile, don’t let the winds that come with her fame snuff it out,” an <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a> user theorized. “You shouldn’t date her, it will blow up the tabloids.”</p><p class=p1>They added, “The second verse is about how she is shut away for the good of her potential partners. She’s the bad seed and the temptress, so shutting her away reduces the danger (less dagger to sharpen). But she escapes confinement anyway to visit her partner (who dgaf about the danger).”</p><p class=p1>Kelce, for his part, has made it clear that he understands<a href=#> the “good reason” why people</a> “care” about Swift so much and asserted that he’s enjoying their public and private life together.</p><p class=p1>Another <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a> fan pointed out that “The Albatross” is about “men [being] scared of falling” for Swift since she’s a so-called “man-eater and serial dater,” but they date her regardless. A separate social media user posited that the NFL critics — not Kelce — made Swift feel like an albatross.</p><p class=p1>“Given everyone warned Trav he was distracted all because of her, the football dudes made her feel she was the albatross around his neck,” the X user wrote. “He never made her feel that way and cast off all the doomsayers.&nbsp; In fact, he played better when she was there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The term “albatross” <a href=#>has multiple meanings</a>, referring to either an oceanic bird, a source of frustration and guilt, or a “double eagle” move in golf. If a person is called an albatross, it typically means said individual is a psychological burden. The albatross is also one of Swift’s many literary references as the bird appears in <strong>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</strong>’s poem “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” which is interpreted as a story of salvation.</p><p class=p1>While Swift has not explained her lyrical inspiration for “The Albatross,” she did drop a subtle clue that <a href=#>“So High School”</a> is about Kelce. In the official lyric music video, she highlights their respective initials (TK and TS) in pale pink as the words to the track flash on screen.</p><p class=p1><i>The Tortured Poets Department </i>is out <a href=# rel=noopener>now</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWWlru0edOhoKejXam1pnnApZmarKKkwLR5yKxkmpqfqsFuwNGaraKrXaCyra%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-think-the-albatross-is-about-travis-kelce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-think-the-albatross-is-about-travis-kelce.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-think-the-albatross-is-about-travis-kelce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-think-the-albatross-is-about-travis-kelce.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-think-the-albatross-is-about-travis-kelce.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-think-the-albatross-is-about-travis-kelce.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./travis-kelce-denies-he-s-serious-about-taylor-swift-by-insisting-they-re-just-having-fun.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./travis-kelce-denies-he-s-serious-about-taylor-swift-by-insisting-they-re-just-having-fun.html>Travis Kelce Denies Hes Serious About Taylor Swift By Insisting Theyre Just Having Fun</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./love-island-dale-mehmet-biography-meet-him-on-instagram.html>Love Island : Dale Mehmet Biography Meet Him On Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./love-island-dale-mehmet-biography-meet-him-on-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
