<time>16 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>In the modern <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>world, it often seems like the media loves covering stories about artists feuding more than anything else. For that reason, it is common knowledge that <a href=#>Madonna and Mariah Carey don't get along</a> and there has been a lot of coverage about <a href=#>Pink and Christina Aguilera's relationship</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What some younger people may not realize is that musicians feuding isn't anything new as anyone who likes Fleetwood Mac should already know. Amazingly enough, one accomplished music journalist believes that Bob Dylan and Neil Young once had a bitter one-sided feud.</p><h2 id=why-a-journalist-thinks-bob-dylan-feuded-with-neil-young-musically>Why A Journalist Thinks Bob Dylan Feuded With Neil Young Musically</h2><p>In rock 'n' roll history, there are very few artists who've achieved anywhere close to the kind of success that Bob Dylan and Neil Young have enjoyed. For that reason, Dylan was inducted into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and Young was inducted as a solo artist in 1995 and as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bob-Dylan-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than two decades before Dylan was honored in the Hall of Fame, he rose to fame in the '60s. Looking back at music history, there is no denying that Dylan's music influenced an entire generation of fans and many of his peers as well.</p><p>Since Dylan influenced so many artists, most people would likely assume that he would embrace that. However, when Dylan spoke to the journalist Scott Cohen from Spin magazine in 1985, he went out of his way to call out how much Young was influenced by him.</p><p>According to what Dylan explained while talking to Spin's interviewer, he resented one of Young's most famous songs because he felt it was too similar to his own work.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Phil Collins' Complicated Relationship With His Daughter, Lily Collins</a></span></p><p>"The only time it bothered me that someone sounded like me was when I was living in Phoenix, Arizona, in about '72 and the big song at the time was "Heart of Gold." I used to hate it when it came on the radio. I always liked Neil Young, but it bothered me every time I listened to 'Heart of Gold.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dylan continued, "I think it was up at number one for a long time, and I'd say, 'S**t, that's me. If it sounds like me, it should as well be me.'"</p><p>"There I was, stuck on the desert someplace, having to cool out for a while. New York was a heavy place." Dylan continued explaining what he was going through, "Woodstock was worse, people living in trees outside my house, fans trying to batter down my door, cars following me up dark mountain roads."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/neil-young-at-the-juno-awards-in-2011.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I needed to lay back for a while, forget about things, myself included, and I'd get so far away and turn on the radio and there I am, but it's not me." Dylan finished by saying he hadn't let go of his frustration, "It seemed to me somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow."</p><p>Over the last several decades, the English writer Clint Heylin has written extensively about Dylan's work. As Heylin has explained, he does extensive research about each of Dylan's songs including accessing the singer's notes, looking at liner notes, and more.</p><p>According to Heylin, Dylan's anger at Young ripping him off partially inspired his song "Forever Young". Written when Dylan was in Arizona avoiding the world as the singer described during the aforementioned Spin interview, Heylin reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the song was a shot at Young</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Usher's Feud With Chris Brown And Why The AMA's May Be To Blame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping in mind what Heylin reported about "Forever Young", it is important to note that he is considered a credible reporter. With that in mind and what Heylin has said about his research, it makes sense to take his claim seriously.</p><p>On the other hand, many fans have looked at what Heylin claimed about "Forever Young" and simply think he is wrong. A great example of that is there is a Reddit thread where several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans question Heylon's reporting</a>.</p><p>The reason why fans have trouble with Heylin's reporting mostly relates to "Forever Young's" lyrics. As fans point out, "Forever Young" is a very sentimental song lyrically that appears to be about Dylan becoming a father. Whether Heylin is right or not, the fact remains that Dylan has admitted to resenting one of Young's biggest songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-bob-dylan-and-neil-young-friends>Are Bob Dylan And Neil Young Friends?</h2><p>Putting aside any anger Bob Dylan once had for Neil Young, the two men have had a truly extraordinary friendship for many years. Seen performing onstage together before, Dylan and Young have also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praised each other in lyrics</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bob-dylan-and-neil-young-performing-together-in-2019.jpg><p>In Dylan's song "Highlands", he played tribute to Young with the line "I’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound". Young returned the favor with his song "Flags of Freedom" which includes the lyrics "Listening to Bob Dylan singin’ / In 1963/ Watchin’ the flags of freedom flying".</p><p>More evidence that Dylan and Young are pals comes from someone named Joel Bernstein. A photographer who has worked with both men, Bernstein once described <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much respect they have for each other</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Zac Brown And Luke Bryan Still In A Feud Today?</a></span></p><p>“Bob has watched Neil perform from the side of the stage many times. He has the greatest respect for him. It’s a real accolade for Bob to watch another artist. And Bob is probably the greatest influence on Neil as a singer-songwriter. They have a deep understanding about each other.”</p><p>Most importantly, there have been amusing anecdotes from the past that illustrate Young and Dylan's friendship. One example of that is in 1986, the two singers were interviewed by a reporter together when Dylan put his arm around Young's shoulder and they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">answered questions playfully</a>.</p><p>Perhaps the most amazing story about Dylan and Young centers around a beloved vehicle. Many years ago, Young would travel to gigs in a hearse he adored partially because the curtains allowed people to enjoy smoking a green substance in the back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bob-dylan-performing-in-2019.jpg><p>One time when he was with Young, Dylan decided to take a nap in the back of the hearse without telling anyone. Unfortunately for Dylan, a friend of the duo decided to take the hearse for a spin not knowing anyone was in the back.</p><p>When Dylan came to and realized the hearse was moving, he started banging to let the driver know he was there. When the driver saw Dylan in his mirror, he was so freaked out thinking he saw a ghost that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he drove the vehicle off the road</a>.</p><p>With Dylan in the back of the hearse where there were no seatbelts, he easily could have been in mortal danger. Thankfully Dylan was able to calm the driver down, and he exited the hearse fully intact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dl7yjecOyo5qmXZa7pXnNnqClZamkwq%2BzjJ%2Bpop2emcBuus6wZJqepJq%2Fbq%2FRnpitoaaaeqex1J1m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbob-dylan-and-neil-young-are-friends-now-but-they-once-engaged-in-a-bitter-creative-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbob-dylan-and-neil-young-are-friends-now-but-they-once-engaged-in-a-bitter-creative-feud.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbob-dylan-and-neil-young-are-friends-now-but-they-once-engaged-in-a-bitter-creative-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbob-dylan-and-neil-young-are-friends-now-but-they-once-engaged-in-a-bitter-creative-feud.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbob-dylan-and-neil-young-are-friends-now-but-they-once-engaged-in-a-bitter-creative-feud.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbob-dylan-and-neil-young-are-friends-now-but-they-once-engaged-in-a-bitter-creative-feud.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./coach-john-hynes-wife-sarah-mikla-hynes-is-a-former-all-state-player.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./coach-john-hynes-wife-sarah-mikla-hynes-is-a-former-all-state-player.html>Coach John Hynes Wife Sarah Mikla Hynes Is A Former All-state Player</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./27-best-cyber-monday-deals-under-15-on-amazon.html>27 Best Cyber Monday Deals Under $15 on Amazon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./27-best-cyber-monday-deals-under-15-on-amazon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
