But there's another end of it where it's like, ‘Man, this is a lot.'"</p><p>"[But it’s] another level of stardom that typically football players don't deal with,” Travis’ older brother explained. "So, on one hand, really, really happy for my brother and where he's at in his current situation with Taylor. But on the other hand, there's some alarms sometimes with how over-in-pursuit people can be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Overall, he can deal with some of this," he went on.
