They target their music to a certain group of people. They get inspiration for their music from one place, and they usually only sing in one language. BTS is different. They came in and changed the way people see boy bands through their versatility. Keep scrolling to see why BTS is the most versatile boy band ever.</p><h2 id=their-billboard-awards-appearance><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Their Billboard Awards Appearance</span></h2><p>It was no surprise that BTS won the Best Social Artist at the Billboard Awards. They yield incredible power over the music industry, simply because they have a huge fan base. Despite whatever nerves they may have felt, they knew that they were paving the way for k-pop in the mainstream media. They were there representing an entire genre of music, and they rocked it. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They even got to meet some of their favorite music artists like Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-wings-tour><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Their WINGS Tour</span></h2><p>The WINGS tour showed the world how much support BTS really had. Especially when they were in the United States. Thousands of fans were unable to get tickets because every stadium and venue sold out instantly. This is unheard of in the United States for a k-pop band. The WINGS tour had every venue packed to the max, and they continue to do so in their more recent performances. Seeing BTS perform live is one of the most coveted experiences in the music industry right now.</p><h2 id=mic-drop---featuring-steve-aoki><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mic Drop - Featuring Steve Aoki</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>BTS has had some great songs in their discography. Their ARMY seems to love every single one that comes out. Recently, they have also scored some amazing collaborations with artists like Zedd and Chainsmokers. However, nothing can compare to their collaboration with Steve Aoki on Mic Drop. This song helped push them into the Top 40 hits. They were the first k-pop band to make it into the Top 40, ever. This song is just another way that they made a great name for themselves and showed how their versatility pays off.</p><h2 id=bts-and-the-amas><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>BTS And The AMAs</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>BTS had their first live televised performance at the AMAs, and they rocked it. The fan chants were cacophonous, and you could not help but cheer along. The boy band and their fans knew that this was a huge moment and that it really showed how BTS is a band of trailblazers in the k-pop industry. They performed their hit song DNA and rocked the theater. Their choreography and vocals were on point, despite whatever nerves they may have felt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ansel Elgort was there</a>, and having so much fun he became a huge fan of BTS. This performance brought them officially into mainstream pop culture in the United States.</p><h2 id=smashing-interviews-in-america><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Smashing Interviews In America</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that this k-pop band is rooted in Korea, most of the members-only speak Korean. RM, the group leader, is the only one who is completely fluent in English. This means that he had to represent and speak for his fellow band members at all of the interviews and press tours that BTS attended. This pressure could have made him crack, but it didn't. His band members supported him in every way that they could, and it definitely helped them get through the challenges associated with being interviewed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="#Scammys Trends After BTS Grammy Snub">#Scammys Trends After BTS Grammy Snub</a></span></p><h2 id=the-bts-army><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The BTS ARMY</span></h2><p>The ARMY is the name given to the fan base for BTS.<a href=#> ARMY spans internationally and has hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of members.</a> They united when their favorite k-pop band was nominated for awards. They would pull all-nighters, make multiple social media accounts, and even create special voting algorithms to help BTS win awards and succeed in the United States and beyond. They put in work to make BTS content accessible<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> by subbing countless videos and retyping interviews</a>. There is no other band in history to have such devoted fans on this big of a scale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dna-music-video><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>DNA Music Video</span></h2><p>DNA is one of BTS's most popular songs, to date. This song, alone, showed the versatility that each band member had in their vocals. The song is upbeat, but has serious moments too. The video only further show's the band's versatility. They have incredible choreography in every music video, but the DNA music video is without comparison. They showed off their dancing technical skills while showing their personality. There were no "cookie-cutter" moments in the video. The whole thing is cutting edge, and it really shows how BTS is one of the most versatile boy bands in the history of the music industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title='Ashley Park Gets Emotional Over BTS Members&#39; Love For Her "Dynamite" Performance'>Ashley Park Gets Emotional Over BTS Members' Love For Her "Dynamite" Performance</a></span></p><h2 id=behind-the-scenes-content><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Behind The Scenes Content</span></h2><p>How many musicians, let alone boy bands, do you know that want their fans to get an inside look at their life off-stage? Not very many. BTS is different. They film behind the scenes content and daily life vlogs to show their fans who they are outside their performances. Fans get to see exclusive content like rehearsals. These videos give the ARMY a sense of intimacy and connection with the band members that other bands just do not have. They also get to see that each member of BTS has interests outside of music, and that they are all talented in their own ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="BTS And James Corden Patch Things Up By Blocking LA Crosswalk">BTS And James Corden Patch Things Up By Blocking LA Crosswalk</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZqyZorJurtOsZKmqn6uypXnToZyyZZGnsm7Ax55kpqejqXq3sdGsmK2hnJp6o7vYZpmappRisrex0Wg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbts-may-just-be-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever-here-s-why.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charity-nye-net-worth-how-much-is-charity-nye-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charity-nye-net-worth-how-much-is-charity-nye-worth.html>Charity Nye Net Worth How Much is Charity Nye Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./all-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html>All The Celebs Close To Marilyn Manson Who Have Spoken Out Since The Allegations</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./all-the-celebs-close-to-marilyn-manson-who-have-spoken-out-since-the-allegations.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
