Thanks to the news that Pauly Shore played Simmons in a short film called The Court Jester and will appear in a biopic about him, there has been a fascinating update.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-richard-simmons>What Happened To Richard Simmons?</h2><p>For the past decade, fans have wondered where Richard Simmons is. For a long time, it didn't seem like he would ever make a public comment. In January 2024, however, he decided to post on Facebook, and he explained what he had been doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/richard-simmons-2.jpg><p>According to Variety, when a <strong>biopic about Richard Simmons</strong> was announced, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simmons spoke about the movie</a> and said that he didn't authorize it.

You may have heard they may be doing a movie about me with Pauly Shore. I have never given my permission for this movie. So don’t believe everything you read. I no longer have a manager, and I no longer have a publicist. I just try to live a quiet life and be peaceful. Thank you for all your love and support.”</p><p>Of course, this post got everyone talking. People were surprised to hear from Simmons and also glad to hear that he was doing well. Just like <a href=#>Jane Fonda earned a lot from her workout videos</a>, Simmons has been living a comfortable life for a while now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Richard-Simmons-Sweatin-to-the-Oldies-poster.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Here's Why Richard Simmons Never Married</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Richard Simmons has been in the spotlight for decades thanks to his surprisingly popular fitness empire.</span><p>On January 17th, 2024, Simmons posted on X and said that he doesn't have anyone else running his business anymore.
