Apparently, the two were somewhat set up by their parents. Dr. Oz’s father and Lisa’s dad decided to go out to dinner with their children in tow. However, Lisa didn’t know who Dr. Oz was.

He recalled to Yahoo Lifestyle, “We dated for about seven months, and then we got into a big fight, and I realized I couldn’t live my life without Lisa.” And then, Dr. Oz proceeded to chase her down the street and propose to her using a tab from an aluminum can. He said that he then told her, “It’s not much, but I’ll make something out of this. Let me marry you.”</p><h2 id=he-and-his-wife-set-up-an-oz-olympics-for-their-family><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>He And His Wife Set Up An Oz Olympics For Their Family</span></h2><p>To help keep their four children in shape when they were younger, Dr. Oz and his wife decided to create the Oz Olympics. It also helped highlight the kids’ individual abilities. Lisa told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shape</a>, “Some were better at throwing balls, some were faster at running. So Mehmet developed game-like competitions where each child could win a medal. That's how we spent many evenings when they were little.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dr-oz-likes-to-renew-his-marriage-every-seven-years><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Dr. Oz Likes To Renew His Marriage Every Seven Years</span></h2><p>Dr. Oz is one husband who likes to renew his vows as regularly as possible. And for him and wife, that means doing it every seven years. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, he explained, “Every seven years you have to reinvent the relationship – this is true not just for marriage, it’s true for work and other friendships – but especially in a marriage.”</p><h2 id=he-s-got-serious-connections-with-baseball-pros><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>He’s Got Serious Connections With Baseball Pros</span></h2><p>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, Dr. Oz said, “I transplanted Frank Torre, brother of Yankee manager Joe Torre, just before the 1996 World Series.

Drawing on viable unseen energies, Reiki masters like Pamela Miles and Julie Motz have melded their expertise with Oz’s mastery as a heart surgeon.”</p><h2 id=he-warned-viewers-about-arsenic-in-apple-juice-but-said-his-kids-can-keep-drinking-it><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Warned Viewers About Arsenic In Apple Juice But Said His Kids Can Keep Drinking It</span></h2><p>In 2011, Dr. Oz came under fire for alleging that several brands of apple juice contained dangerous levels of arsenic. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded with a statement saying, “There is no evidence of any public health risk from drinking these juices. And FDA has been testing them for years.” Meanwhile, Dr. Oz later told Associated Press that he still wouldn’t hesitate to give his children apple juice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-got-into-legal-trouble-for-making-fake-claims-about-olive-oil><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Got Into Legal Trouble For Making Fake Claims About Olive Oil</span></h2><p>At one point in his show, Dr. Oz. made a claim that some imported olive oil available in U.S. supermarkets may be fake. In particular, he claimed that “[A] shocking 80% of the extra virgin olive oil that you buy every day in your supermarket isn’t the real deal,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. In response, the North American Olive Oil Association (NAOOA) filed a lawsuit against the doctor. Eventually, however, the suit was dismissed.</p><h2 id=physicians-demanded-for-his-dismissal-from-columbia-university><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Physicians Demanded For His Dismissal From Columbia University</span></h2><p style=text-align:left>In 2015, 10 doctors sent a letter to Columbia University, accusing Dr. Oz of “an egregious lack of integrity.” According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, the letter claimed, “Dr. Oz has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops. Worst of all, he has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=throughout-his-controversies-oprah-winfrey-kept-supporting-him><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Throughout His Controversies, Oprah Winfrey Kept Supporting Him</span></h2><p>While speaking with People at the HealthCorps Annual Gala in New York City, Dr. Oz. said, “Oprah’s a very supportive woman. She’s very mothering.” He added, “She said, ‘You’re not unique, it’s part of the experience of life.’” As you may know, Winfrey had helped popularize Dr. Oz. Moreover, during an appearance on “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” he was also referred to as “America’s doctor.”</p><h2 id=he-met-oprah-while-working-on-a-documentary><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Met Oprah While Working On A Documentary</span></h2><p>During a chat on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN’s SportsNation</a>, Dr. Oz recalled, “Oprah came on my documentary series entitled "Second Opinion" on Discovery Channel.

While speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>, he explained, “We very purposely, on the logo, have 'Oz' as the middle, and the 'Doctor' is actually up in the little bar for a reason. I want folks to realize that I'm a doctor, and I'm coming into their lives to be supportive of them. But it's not a medical show.”</p><h2 id=he-claimed-that-chickpeas-and-dark-chocolate-can-fight-anxiety><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Claimed That Chickpeas And Dark Chocolate Can Fight Anxiety</span></h2><p>In 2017, Dr. Oz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted </a>a link to an article claiming that seven foods, including dark chocolate and chickpeas, can fight anxiety. In response, an op-ed on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes </a>stated, “It might seem harmless at first glance, but suggesting that anxiety disorders can be treated with food is irresponsible—these disorders affect millions of Americans and are often debilitating.”</p><h2 id=he-claimed-that-green-coffee-extract-has-weight-loss-magic><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Claimed That Green Coffee Extract Has Weight Loss ‘Magic’</span></h2><p>In 2012, Dr. Oz aired a segment entitled “Green Coffee Bean Extract: The Fat Burner That Works” where he declared, “This miracle pill can burn fat fast, for anyone who wants to lose weight.” The problem was he based this declaration on a dubious study, one that only involved 16 people, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. Because of this, Dr. Oz came under harsh criticism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-enjoys-endorsing-weight-loss-supplements><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Enjoys Endorsing Weight Loss Supplements</span></h2><p>Over the years, Dr. Oz has endorsed a number of weight loss supplements on his show.

According to the website <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Class Actions</a>, the lawsuit stated, “As a renowned surgeon at Columbia University with specialized medical and scientific knowledge, Dr. Oz knew that the claims he was making about the supplements being ‘miracle fat busters’ were patently false or misleading consumers.” It was later settled.</p><h2 id=he-did-come-clean-about-the-weight-loss-supplement-issue-but-blamed-his-marketers-too><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Did Come Clean About The Weight Loss Supplement Issue, But Blamed His Marketers Too</span></h2><p>While speaking with Fox News, Dr. Oz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, “I wish I’d never used the laudatory terms I used for weight loss supplements.
